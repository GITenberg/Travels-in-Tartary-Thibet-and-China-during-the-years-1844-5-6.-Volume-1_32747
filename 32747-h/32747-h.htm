i</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The Pope having, about the year 1844, been pleased to
establish an Apostolic Vicariat of Mongolia, it was considered
expedient, with a view to further operations, to ascertain the
nature and extent of the diocese thus created, and MM. Gabet and
Huc, two Lazarists attached to the petty mission of Si-Wang, were
accordingly deputed to collect the necessary information. They
made their way through difficulties which nothing but religious
enthusiasm in combination with French elasticity could have
overcome, to Lha-Ssa, the capital of Thibet, and in this seat of
Lamanism were becoming comfortably settled, with lively hopes and
expectations of converting the Tal&eacute;-Lama into a
branch-Pope, when the Chinese Minister, the noted Ke-Shen,
interposed on political grounds, and had them deported to
China.&nbsp; M. Gabet was directed by his superiors to proceed to
France, and lay a complaint before his Government, of the
arbitrary treatment which he and his fellow Missionary had
experienced.&nbsp; In the steamer which conveyed him from Hong
Kong to Ceylon, he found Mr. Alexander Johnstone, secretary to
Her Majesty&rsquo;s <!-- page ii--><a name="pageii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ii</span>Plenipotentiary in China; and this
gentleman perceived so much, not merely of entertainment, but of
important information in the conversations he had with M. Gabet,
that he committed to paper the leading features of the Reverend
Missionary&rsquo;s statements, and on his return to his official
post, gave his manuscripts to Sir John Davis, who, in his turn,
considered their contents so interesting, that he embodied a copy
of them in a dispatch to Lord Palmerston.&nbsp; Subsequently the
two volumes, here translated, were prepared by M. Huc, and
published in Paris.&nbsp; Thus it is, that to Papal aggression in
the East, the Western World is indebted for a work exhibiting,
for the first time, a complete representation of countries
previously almost unknown to Europeans, and indeed considered
practically inaccessible; and of a religion which, followed by no
fewer than 170,000,000 persons, presents the most singular
analogies in its leading features with the Catholicism of
Rome.</p>

</a>The French mission of Peking, once so flourishing under the
early emperors of the Tartar-Mantchou dynasty, was almost
extirpated by the constant persecutions of Kia-King, the fifth
monarch of that dynasty, who ascended the throne in 1799.&nbsp;
The missionaries were dispersed or put to death, and at that time
Europe was herself too deeply agitated to enable her to send
succour to this distant Christendom, which remained for a time
abandoned.&nbsp; Accordingly, when the French Lazarists
re-appeared at Peking, they found there scarce a vestige of the
true faith.&nbsp; A great number of Christians, to avoid <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>the persecutions of the Chinese authorities, had passed
the Great Wall, and sought peace and liberty in the deserts of
Tartary, where they lived dispersed upon small patches of land
which the Mongols permitted them to cultivate.&nbsp; By dint of
perseverance the missionaries collected together these dispersed
Christians, placed themselves at their head, and hence
superintended the mission of Peking, the immediate administration
of which was in the hands of a few Chinese Lazarists.&nbsp; The
French missionaries could not, with any prudence, have resumed
their former position in the capital of the empire.&nbsp; Their
presence would have compromised the prospects of the scarcely
reviving mission.</p>
<p>In visiting the Chinese Christians of Mongolia, we more than
once had occasion to make excursions into the Land of Grass,
(<i>Isao-Ti</i>), as the uncultivated portions of Tartary are
designated, and to take up our temporary abode beneath the tents
of the Mongols.&nbsp; We were no sooner acquainted with this
nomadic people, than we loved them, and our hearts were filled
with a passionate desire to announce the gospel to them.&nbsp;
Our whole leisure was therefore devoted to acquiring the Tartar
dialects, and in 1842, the Holy See at length fulfilled our
desires, by erecting Mongolia into an Apostolical Vicariat.</p>
<p>Towards the commencement of the year 1844, couriers arrived at
Si-wang, a small Christian community, where the vicar apostolic
of Mongolia had fixed his episcopal residence.&nbsp; Si-wang
itself is a village, north of the Great Wall, one day&rsquo;s
journey from Suen-hoa-Fou.&nbsp; The prelate sent us instructions
for an extended voyage we were to undertake for the purpose of
studying the character and manners of the Tartars, and of
ascertaining as nearly as possible the extent and limits of the
Vicariat.&nbsp; This journey, then, which we had so long
meditated, was now determined upon; and we sent a young Lama
convert in search of some camels which we had put to pasture in
the kingdom of Naiman.&nbsp; Pending his absence, we hastened the
completion of several Mongol works, the translation of which had
occupied us for a considerable time.&nbsp; Our little books of
prayer and doctrine were ready, still our young Lama had not
returned; but thinking he could not delay much longer, we quitted
the valley of Black Waters (<i>H&eacute;-Chuy</i>), and proceeded
on to await his arrival at the Contiguous Defiles
(<i>Pi&eacute;-li&eacute;-Keou</i>) which seemed more favourable
for the completion of our preparations.&nbsp; The days passed
away in futile expectation; the coolness of the autumn was
becoming somewhat biting, and we feared that we should have to
begin our journey across the deserts of Tartary during the frosts
of winter.&nbsp; We determined, therefore, to dispatch some one
in quest of our camels and our Lama.&nbsp; A friendly <!-- page
11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>catechist, a good walker and a man of expedition,
proceeded on this mission.&nbsp; On the day fixed for that
purpose he returned; his researches had been wholly without
result.&nbsp; All he had ascertained at the place which he had
visited was, that our Lama had started several days before with
our camels.&nbsp; The surprise of our courier was extreme when he
found that the Lama had not reached us before himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;are my legs quicker than
a camel&rsquo;s!&nbsp; They left Naiman before me, and here I am
arrived before them!&nbsp; My spiritual fathers, have patience
for another day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer that both Lama and
camels will be here in that time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several days,
however, passed away, and we were still in the same
position.&nbsp; We once more dispatched the courier in search of
the Lama, enjoining him to proceed to the very place where the
camels had been put to pasture, to examine things with his own
eyes, and not to trust to any statement that other people might
make.</p>
<p>During this interval of painful suspense, we continued to
inhabit the Contiguous Defiles, a Tartar district dependent on
the kingdom of Ouniot. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; These regions
appear to have been affected by great revolutions.&nbsp; The
present inhabitants state that, in the olden time, the country
was occupied by Corean tribes, who, expelled thence in the course
of various wars, took refuge in the peninsula which they still
possess, between the Yellow Sea and the sea of Japan.&nbsp; You
often, in these parts of Tartary, meet with the remains of great
towns, and the ruins of fortresses, very nearly resembling those
of the middle ages in Europe, and, upon turning up the soil in
these places, it is not unusual to find lances, arrows, portions
of farming implements, and urns filled with Corean money.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the 17th century, the Chinese began to
penetrate into this district.&nbsp; At that period, the whole
landscape was still one of rude grandeur; the mountains were
covered with fine forests, and the Mongol tents whitened the
valleys, amid rich pasturages.&nbsp; For a very moderate sum the
Chinese obtained permission to cultivate the desert, and as
cultivation advanced, the Mongols were obliged to retreat,
conducting their flocks and herds elsewhere.</p>
<p>From that time forth, the aspect of the country became
entirely changed.&nbsp; All the trees were grubbed up, the
forests disappeared from the hills, the prairies were cleared by
means of fire, and the new cultivators set busily to work in
exhausting the fecundity of the soil.&nbsp; Almost the entire
region is now in the hands of the Chinese, and it is probably to
their system of devastation that we must <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>attribute the
extreme irregularity of the seasons which now desolate this
unhappy land.&nbsp; Droughts are of almost annual occurrence; the
spring winds setting in, dry up the soil; the heavens assume a
sinister aspect, and the unfortunate population await, in utter
terror, the manifestation of some terrible calamity; the winds by
degrees redouble their violence, and sometimes continue to blow
far into the summer months.&nbsp; Then the dust rises in clouds,
the atmosphere becomes thick and dark; and often, at mid-day, you
are environed with the terrors of night, or rather, with an
intense and almost palpable blackness, a thousand times more
fearful than the most sombre night.&nbsp; Next after these
hurricanes comes the rain: but so comes, that instead of being an
object of desire, it is an object of dread, for it pours down in
furious raging torrents.&nbsp; Sometimes the heavens suddenly
opening, pour forth in, as it were, an immense cascade, all the
water with which they are charged in that quarter; and
immediately the fields and their crops disappear under a sea of
mud, whose enormous waves follow the course of the valleys, and
carry everything before them.&nbsp; The torrent rushes on, and in
a few hours the earth reappears; but the crops are gone, and
worse even than that, the arable soil also has gone with
them.&nbsp; Nothing remains but a ramification of deep ruts,
filled with gravel, and thenceforth incapable of being
ploughed.</p>
<p>Hail is of frequent occurrence in these unhappy districts, and
the dimensions of the hailstones are generally enormous.&nbsp; We
have ourselves seen some that weighed twelve pounds.&nbsp; One
moment sometimes suffices to exterminate whole flocks.&nbsp; In
1843, during one of these storms, there was heard in the air a
sound as of a rushing wind, and therewith fell, in a field near a
house, a mass of ice larger than an ordinary millstone.&nbsp; It
was broken to pieces with hatchets, yet, though the sun burned
fiercely, three days elapsed before these pieces entirely
melted.</p>
<p>The droughts and the inundations together, sometimes occasion
famines which well nigh exterminate the inhabitants.&nbsp; That
of 1832, in the twelfth year of the reign of <i>Tao-Kouang</i>,
<a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> is the most terrible of these on
record.&nbsp; The Chinese report that it was everywhere announced
by a general presentiment, the exact nature of which no one could
explain or comprehend.&nbsp; During the winter of 1831, a dark
rumour grew into circulation.&nbsp; <i>Next year</i>, it was
said, <i>there will be neither rich nor poor</i>; <i>blood will
cover the mountains</i>; <i>bones will fill the valleys</i> (Ou
fou, ou kioung; hue man chan, kou man tchouan.)&nbsp; These words
were in every one&rsquo;s mouth; the children repeated them in
their sports; all were under the <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>domination of
these sinister apprehensions when the year 1832 commenced.&nbsp;
Spring and summer passed away without rain, and the frosts of
autumn set in while the crops were yet green; these crops of
course perished, and there was absolutely no harvest.&nbsp; The
population was soon reduced to the most entire destitution.&nbsp;
Houses, fields, cattle, everything was exchanged for grain, the
price of which attained its weight in gold.&nbsp; When the grass
on the mountain sides was devoured by the starving creatures, the
depths of the earth were dug into for roots.&nbsp; The fearful
prognostic, that had been so often repeated, became
accomplished.&nbsp; Thousands died upon the hills, whither they
had crawled in search of grass; dead bodies filled the roads and
houses; whole villages were depopulated to the last man.&nbsp;
There was, indeed, <i>neither rich nor poor</i>; pitiless famine
had levelled all alike.</p>
<p>It was in this dismal region that we awaited with impatience
the courier, whom, for a second time, we had dispatched into the
kingdom of Naiman.&nbsp; The day fixed for his return came and
passed, and several others followed, but brought no camels, nor
Lama, nor courier, which seemed to us most astonishing of
all.&nbsp; We became desperate; we could not longer endure this
painful and futile suspense.&nbsp; We devised other means of
proceeding, since those we had arranged appeared to be
frustrated.&nbsp; The day of our departure was fixed; it was
settled, further, that one of our Christians should convey us in
his car to <i>Tolon-Noor</i>, distant from the Contiguous Defiles
about fifty leagues.&nbsp; At <i>Tolon-Noor</i> we were to
dismiss our temporary conveyance, proceed alone into the desert,
and thus start on our pilgrimage as well as we could.&nbsp; This
project absolutely stupified our Christian friends; they could
not comprehend how two Europeans should undertake by themselves a
long journey through an unknown and inimical country: but we had
reasons for abiding by our resolution.&nbsp; We did not desire
that any Chinese should accompany us.&nbsp; It appeared to us
absolutely necessary to throw aside the fetters with which the
authorities had hitherto contrived to shackle missionaries in
China.&nbsp; The excessive caution, or rather the imbecile
pusillanimity of a Chinese catechist, was calculated rather to
impede than to facilitate our progress in Tartary.</p>
<p>On the Sunday, the day preceding our arranged departure, every
thing was ready; our small trunks were packed and padlocked, and
the Christians had assembled to bid us adieu.&nbsp; On this very
evening, to the infinite surprise of all of us, our courier
arrived.&nbsp; As he advanced his mournful countenance told us
before he spoke, that his intelligence was unfavourable.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My spiritual fathers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all is lost;
you have nothing to hope; in the kingdom of Naiman there no
longer exists any camels of the Holy Church.&nbsp; The Lama <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>doubtless has been killed; and I have no doubt the devil
has had a direct hand in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubts and fears are often harder to bear than the certainty
of evil.&nbsp; The intelligence thus received, though lamentable
in itself, relieved us from our perplexity as to the past,
without in any way altering our plan for the future.&nbsp; After
having received the condolences of our Christians, we retired to
rest, convinced that this night would certainly be that preceding
our nomadic life.</p>
<p>The night was far advanced, when suddenly numerous voices were
heard outside our abode, and the door was shaken with loud and
repeated knocks.&nbsp; We rose at once; the Lama, the camels, all
had arrived; there was quite a little revolution.&nbsp; The order
of the day was instantly changed.&nbsp; We resolved to depart,
not on the Monday, but on the Tuesday; not in a car, but on
camels, in true Tartar fashion.&nbsp; We returned to our beds
perfectly delighted; but we could not sleep, each of us occupying
the remainder of the night with plans for effecting the equipment
of the caravan in the most expeditious manner possible.</p>
<p>Next day, while we were making our preparations for departure,
our Lama explained his extraordinary delay.&nbsp; First, he had
undergone a long illness; then he had been occupied a
considerable time in pursuing a camel which had escaped into the
desert; and finally, he had to go before some tribunal, in order
to procure the restitution of a mule which had been stolen from
him.&nbsp; A law-suit, an illness, and a camel hunt were amply
sufficient reasons for excusing the delay which had
occurred.&nbsp; Our courier was the only person who did not
participate in the general joy; he saw it must be evident to
every one that he had not fulfilled his mission with any sort of
skill.</p>
<p>All Monday was occupied in the equipment of our caravan.&nbsp;
Every person gave his assistance to this object.&nbsp; Some
repaired our travelling-house, that is to say, mended or patched
a great blue linen tent; others cut for us a supply of wooden
tent pins; others mended the holes in our copper kettle, and
renovated the broken leg of a joint stool; others prepared cords,
and put together the thousand and one pieces of a camel&rsquo;s
pack.&nbsp; Tailors, carpenters, braziers, rope-makers,
saddle-makers, people of all trades assembled in active
co-operation in the court-yard of our humble abode.&nbsp; For
all, great and small, among our Christians, were resolved that
their spiritual fathers should proceed on their journey as
comfortably as possible.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, there remained nothing to be done but to
perforate the nostrils of the camels, and to insert in the
aperture a wooden peg, to use as a sort of bit.&nbsp; The
arrangement of this was <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>left to our Lama.&nbsp; The wild
piercing cries of the poor animals pending the painful operation,
soon collected together all the Christians of the village.&nbsp;
At this moment, our Lama became exclusively the hero of the
expedition.&nbsp; The crowd ranged themselves in a circle around
him; every one was curious to see how, by gently pulling the cord
attached to the peg in its nose, our Lama could make the animal
obey him, and kneel at his pleasure.&nbsp; Then, again, it was an
interesting thing for the Chinese to watch our Lama packing on
the camels&rsquo; backs the baggage of the two missionary
travellers.&nbsp; When the arrangements were completed, we drank
a cup of tea, and proceeded to the chapel; the Christians recited
prayers for our safe journey; we received their farewell,
interrupted with tears, and proceeded on our way.&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba, our Lama cameleer, gravely mounted on a black,
stunted, meagre mule, opened the march, leading two camels laden
with our baggage; then came the two missionaries, MM. Gabet and
Huc, the former mounted on a tall camel, the latter on a white
horse.</p>

src="images/p15.jpg" />
</a>Upon our departure we were resolved to lay aside our
accustomed usages, and to become regular Tartars.&nbsp; Yet we
did not at the outset, and all at once, become exempt from the
Chinese system.&nbsp; Besides that, for the first mile or two of
our journey, we were escorted by our Chinese Christians, some on
foot, and some on horseback; our first stage was to be an inn
kept by the Grand Catechist of the Contiguous Defiles.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>The progress of our little caravan was not at first
wholly successful.&nbsp; We were quite novices in the art of
saddling and girdling camels, so that every five minutes we had
to halt, either to rearrange some cord or piece of wood that hurt
and irritated the camels, or to consolidate upon their backs, as
well as we could, the ill-packed baggage that threatened, ever
and anon, to fall to the ground.&nbsp; We advanced, indeed,
despite all these delays, but still very slowly.&nbsp; After
journeying about thirty-five lis, <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> we quitted the
cultivated district and entered upon the Land of Grass.&nbsp;
There we got on much better; the camels were more at their ease
in the desert, and their pace became more rapid.</p>
<p>We ascended a high mountain, where the camels evinced a
decided tendency to compensate themselves for their trouble, by
browzing, on either side, upon the tender stems of the elder tree
or the green leaves of the wild rose.&nbsp; The shouts we were
obliged to keep up, in order to urge forward the indolent beasts,
alarmed infinite foxes, who issued from their holes and rushed
off in all directions.&nbsp; On attaining the summit of the
rugged hill we saw in the hollow beneath the Christian inn of
<i>Yan-Pa-Eul</i>.&nbsp; We proceeded towards it, our road
constantly crossed by fresh and limpid streams, which, issuing
from the sides of the mountain, reunite at its foot and form a
rivulet which encircles the inn.&nbsp; We were received by the
landlord, or, as the Chinese call him, the Comptroller of the
Chest.</p>
<p>Inns of this description occur at intervals in the deserts of
Tartary, along the confines of China.&nbsp; They consist almost
universally of a large square enclosure, formed by high poles
interlaced with brushwood.&nbsp; In the centre of this enclosure
is a mud house, never more than ten feet high.&nbsp; With the
exception of a few wretched rooms at each extremity, the entire
structure consists of one large apartment, serving at once for
cooking, eating, and sleeping; thoroughly dirty, and full of
smoke and intolerable stench.&nbsp; Into this pleasant place all
travellers, without distinction, are ushered, the portion of
space applied to their accommodation being a long, wide
<i>Kang</i>, as it is called, a sort of furnace, occupying more
than three-fourths of the apartment, about four feet high, and
the flat, smooth surface of which is covered with a reed mat,
which the richer guests cover again with a travelling carpet of
felt, or with furs.&nbsp; In front of it, three immense coppers,
set in glazed earth, serve for the preparation of the
traveller&rsquo;s milk-broth.&nbsp; The apertures by which these
monster boilers are heated communicate with the interior of the
<i>Kang</i>, so that its temperature is constantly maintained at
a high elevation, even in the terrible cold of winter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>
<a href="images/p17.jpg">
<img alt=
"Kang of a Tartar-Chinese Inn"
title=
"Kang of a Tartar-Chinese Inn"
src="images/p17.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Upon the arrival of guests, the Comptroller of the Chest
invites them to ascend the <i>Kang</i>, where they seat
themselves, their legs crossed tailor-fashion, round a large
table, not more than six inches high.&nbsp; The lower part of the
room is reserved for the people of the inn, who there busy
themselves in keeping up the fire under the cauldrons, boiling
tea, and pounding oats and buckwheat into flour for the repast of
the travellers.&nbsp; The <i>Kang</i> of these Tartar-Chinese
inns is, till evening, a stage full of animation, where the
guests eat, drink, smoke, gamble, dispute, and fight: with
night-fall, the refectory, tavern, and gambling-house of the day
is suddenly converted into a dormitory.&nbsp; The travellers who
have any bed-clothes unroll and arrange them; those who have
none, settle themselves as best they may in their personal
attire, and lie down, side by side, round the table.&nbsp; When
the guests are very numerous they arrange themselves in two
circles, feet to feet.&nbsp; Thus reclined, those so disposed,
sleep; others, awaiting sleep, smoke, drink tea, and
gossip.&nbsp; The effect of the scene, dimly exhibited by an
imperfect wick floating amid thick, dirty, stinking oil, whose
receptacle is ordinarily a broken tea-cup, is fantastic, and to
the stranger, fearful.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>The Comptroller of the Chest had prepared his own room
for our accommodation.&nbsp; We washed, but would not sleep
there; being now Tartar travellers, and in possession of a good
tent, we determined to try our apprentice hand at setting it
up.&nbsp; This resolution offended no one, it was quite
understood we adopted this course, not out of contempt towards
the inn, but out of love for a patriarchal life.&nbsp; When we
had set up our tent, and unrolled on the ground our goat-skin
beds, we lighted a pile of brushwood, for the nights were already
growing cold.&nbsp; Just as we were closing our eyes, the
Inspector of Darkness startled us with beating the official night
alarum, upon his brazen <i>tam-tam</i>, the sonorous sound of
which, reverberating through the adjacent valleys struck with
terror the tigers and wolves frequenting them, and drove them
off.</p>
<p>We were on foot before daylight.&nbsp; Previous to our
departure we had to perform an operation of considerable
importance&mdash;no other than an entire change of costume, a
complete metamorphosis.&nbsp; The missionaries who reside in
China, all, without exception, wear the secular dress of the
people, and are in no way distinguishable from them; they bear no
outward sign of their religious character.&nbsp; It is a great
pity that they should be thus obliged to wear the secular
costume, for it is an obstacle in the way of their preaching the
gospel.&nbsp; Among the Tartars, a <i>black man</i>&mdash;so they
discriminate the laity, as wearing their hair, from the clergy,
who have their heads close shaved&mdash;who should talk about
religion would be laughed at, as impertinently meddling with
things, the special province of the Lamas, and in no way
concerning him.&nbsp; The reasons which appear to have introduced
and maintained the custom of wearing the secular habit on the
part of the missionaries in China, no longer applying to us, we
resolved at length to appear in an ecclesiastical exterior
becoming our sacred mission.&nbsp; The views of our vicar
apostolic on the subject, as explained in his written
instructions, being conformable with our wish, we did not
hesitate.&nbsp; We resolved to adopt the secular dress of the
Thibetian Lamas; that is to say, the dress which they wear when
not actually performing their idolatrous ministry in the
Pagodas.&nbsp; The costume of the Thibetian Lamas suggested
itself to our preference as being in unison with that worn by our
young neophyte, Samdadchiemba.</p>
<p>We announced to the Christians of the inn that we were
resolved no longer to look like Chinese merchants; that we were
about to cut off our long tails, and to shave our heads.&nbsp;
This intimation created great agitation: some of our disciples
even wept; all sought by their eloquence to divert us from a
resolution which seemed to them fraught with danger; but their
pathetic remonstrances were of no avail; one touch of a razor, in
the hands of Samdadchiemba <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>sufficed to
sever the long tail of hair, which, to accommodate Chinese
fashions, we had so carefully cultivated ever since our departure
from France.&nbsp; We put on a long yellow robe, fastened at the
right side with five gilt buttons, and round the waist by a long
red sash; over this was a red jacket, with a collar of purple
velvet; a yellow cap, surmounted by a red tuft, completed our new
costume.&nbsp; Breakfast followed this decisive operation, but it
was silent and sad.&nbsp; When the Comptroller of the Chest
brought in some glasses and an urn, wherein smoked the hot wine
drunk by the Chinese, we told him that having changed our habit
of dress, we should change also our habit of living.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take away,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;that wine and that
chafing dish; henceforth we renounce drinking and smoking.&nbsp;
You know,&rdquo; added we, laughing, &ldquo;that good Lamas
abstain from wine and tobacco.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Chinese
Christians who surrounded us did not join in the laugh; they
looked at us without speaking and with deep commiseration, fully
persuaded that we should inevitably perish of privation and
misery in the deserts of Tartary.&nbsp; Breakfast finished, while
the people of the inn were packing up our tent, saddling the
camels, and preparing for our departure, we took a couple of
rolls, baked in the steam of the furnace, and walked out to
complete our meal with some wild currants growing on the bank of
the adjacent rivulet.&nbsp; It was soon announced to us that
everything was ready&mdash;so, mounting our respective animals,
we proceeded on the road to Tolon-Noor, accompanied by
Samdadchiemba.</p>

</a>We were now launched, alone and without a guide, amid a new
world.&nbsp; We had no longer before us paths traced out by the
old <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>missionaries, for we were in a country where none before
us had preached Gospel truth.&nbsp; We should no longer have by
our side those earnest Christian converts, so zealous to serve
us; so anxious, by their friendly care, to create around us as it
were an atmosphere of home.&nbsp; We were abandoned to ourselves,
in a hostile land, without a friend to advise or to aid us, save
Him by whose strength we were supported, and whose name we were
seeking to make known to all the nations of the earth.</p>

</a>As we have just observed, Samdadchiemba was our only
travelling companion.&nbsp; This young man was neither Chinese,
nor Tartar, nor Thibetian.&nbsp; Yet, at the first glance, it was
easy to recognise in him the features characterizing that which
naturalists call the Mongol race.&nbsp; A great flat nose,
insolently turned up; a large mouth, slit in a perfectly straight
line, thick, projecting lips, a deep bronze complexion, every
feature contributed to give to his physiognomy a wild and
scornful aspect.&nbsp; When his little eyes seemed starting out
of his head from under their lids, wholly destitute of eyelash,
and he looked at you wrinkling his brow, he inspired you at once
with feelings of dread and yet of confidence.&nbsp; The face was
without any decisive character: it exhibited neither the
mischievous knavery of the Chinese, nor the frank good-nature of
the Tartar, nor the courageous energy of the Thibetian; but was
made up of a mixture of all three.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba was a
<i>Dchiahour</i>.&nbsp; We shall hereafter have occasion to speak
more in detail of the native country of our young cameleer.</p>
<p>At the age of eleven, Samdadchiemba had escaped from his
Lamasery, in order to avoid the too frequent and too severe
corrections of the master under whom he was more immediately
placed.&nbsp; He afterwards passed the greater portion of his
vagabond youth, sometimes in the Chinese towns, sometimes in the
deserts of Tartary.&nbsp; It is easy to comprehend that this
independent course of life had not tended to modify the natural
asperity of his character; his intellect was entirely
uncultivated; but, on the other hand, his muscular power was
enormous, and he was not a little vain of this quality, which he
took great pleasure in parading.&nbsp; After having <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>been
instructed and baptized by M. Gabet, he had attached himself to
the service of the missionaries.&nbsp; The journey we were now
undertaking was perfectly in harmony with his erratic and
adventurous taste.&nbsp; He was, however, of no mortal service to
us as a guide across the deserts of Tartary, for he knew no more
of the country than we knew ourselves.&nbsp; Our only informants
were a compass, and the excellent map of the Chinese empire by
Andriveau-Goujon.</p>
<p>The first portion of our journey, after leaving Yan-Pa-Eul,
was accomplished without interruption, sundry anathemas excepted,
which were hurled against us as we ascended a mountain, by a
party of Chinese merchants, whose mules, upon sight of our camels
and our own yellow attire, became frightened, and took to their
heels at full speed, dragging after them, and in one or two
instances, overturning the waggons to which they were
harnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p21.jpg">
<img alt=
"Mountain of Sain-Oula"

</a></p>
<p>The mountain in question is called <i>Sain-Oula</i> (Good
Mountain), doubtless <i>ut lucus a non lucendo</i>, since it is
notorious for the dismal accidents and tragical adventures of
which it is the theatre.&nbsp; The ascent is by a rough, steep
path, half-choked up with fallen rocks.&nbsp; <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Mid-way up is
a small temple, dedicated to the divinity of the mountain,
<i>Sain-Nai</i>, (the good old Woman;) the occupant is a priest,
whose business it is, from time to time, to fill up the cavities
in the road, occasioned by the previous rains, in consideration
of which service he receives from each passenger a small
gratuity, constituting his revenue.&nbsp; After a toilsome
journey of nearly three hours we found ourselves at the summit of
the mountain, upon an immense plateau, extending from east to
west a long day&rsquo;s journey, and from north to south still
more widely.&nbsp; From this summit you discern, afar off in the
plains of Tartary, the tents of the Mongols, ranged
semi-circularly on the slopes of the hills, and looking in the
distance like so many bee-hives.&nbsp; Several rivers derive
their source from the sides of this mountain.&nbsp; Chief among
these is the <i>Chara-Mouren</i> (Yellow River&mdash;distinct, of
course, from the great Yellow River of China, the
<i>Hoang-Ho</i>)&mdash;the capricious, course of which the eye
can follow on through the kingdom of <i>Gechekten</i>, after
traversing which, and then the district of <i>Naiman</i>, it
passes the stake-boundary into Mantchouria, and flowing from
north to south, falls into the sea, approaching which it assumes
the name <i>L&eacute;ao-Ho</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Good Mountain</i> is noted for its intense
frosts.&nbsp; There is not a winter passes in which the cold
there does not kill many travellers.&nbsp; Frequently whole
caravans, not arriving at their destination on the other side of
the mountain, are sought and found on its bleak road, man and
beast frozen to death.&nbsp; Nor is the danger less from the
robbers and the wild beasts with whom the mountain is a favourite
haunt, or rather a permanent station.&nbsp; Assailed by the
brigands, the unlucky traveller is stripped, not merely of horse
and money, and baggage, but absolutely of the clothes he wears,
and then left to perish from cold and hunger.</p>
<p>Not but that the brigands of these parts are extremely polite
all the while; they do not rudely clap a pistol to your ear, and
bawl at you: &ldquo;Your money or your life!&rdquo;&nbsp; No;
they mildly advance with a courteous salutation: &ldquo;Venerable
elder brother, I am on foot; pray lend me your
horse&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got no money, be good enough to lend me
your purse&mdash;It&rsquo;s quite cold to-day, oblige me with the
loan of your coat.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the venerable elder brother
charitably complies, the matter ends with, &ldquo;Thanks,
brother;&rdquo; but otherwise, the request is forthwith
emphasized with the arguments of a cudgel; and if these do not
convince, recourse is had to the sabre.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The sun declining ere we had traversed this platform, we
resolved to encamp for the night.&nbsp; Our first business was to
seek a position combining the three essentials of fuel, water,
and pasturage; and, having due regard to the ill reputation of
the <i>Good Mountain</i>, privacy from observation as complete as
could be effected.&nbsp; Being novices in travelling, the idea of
robbers haunted us incessantly, and we took everybody we saw to
be a suspicious character, against whom we must be on our
guard.&nbsp; A grassy nook, surrounded by tall trees,
appertaining to the Imperial Forest, fulfilled our
requisites.&nbsp; Unlading our dromedaries, we raised, with no
slight labour, our tent beneath the foliage, and at its entrance
installed our faithful porter, Arsalan, a dog whose size,
strength, and courage well entitled him to his appellation,
which, in the Tartar-Mongol dialect, means
&ldquo;Lion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Collecting some <i>argols</i> <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> and dry branches of trees, our kettle
was soon in agitation, and we threw into the boiling water some
Kouamien, prepared paste, something like Vermicelli, which,
seasoned with some parings of bacon, given us by our friends at
Yan-Pa-Eul, we hoped would furnish satisfaction for the hunger
that began to gnaw us.&nbsp; No sooner was the repast ready, than
each of us, drawing forth from his girdle his wooden cup, filled
it with Kouamien, and raised it to his lips.&nbsp; The
preparation was detestable&mdash;uneatable.&nbsp; The
manufacturers of Kouamien always salt it for its longer
preservation; but this paste of ours had been salted beyond all
endurance.&nbsp; Even Arsalan would not eat the
composition.&nbsp; Soaking it <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>for a while
in cold water, we once more boiled it up, but in vain; the dish
remained nearly as salt as ever: so, abandoning it to Arsalan and
to Samdadchiemba, whose stomach by long use was capable of
anything, we were fain to content ourselves with the
<i>dry-cold</i>, as the Chinese say; and, taking with us a couple
of small loaves, walked into the Imperial Forest, in order at
least to season our repast with an agreeable walk.&nbsp; Our
first nomade supper, however, turned out better than we had
expected, Providence placing in our path numerous
<i>Ngao-la-Eul</i> and <i>Chan-ly-Houng</i> trees, the former, a
shrub about five inches high, which bears a pleasant wild cherry;
the other, also a low but very bushy shrub, producing a small
scarlet apple, of a sharp agreeable flavour, of which a very
succulent jelly is made.</p>
<p>The Imperial Forest extends more than a hundred leagues from
north to south, and nearly eighty from east to west.&nbsp; The
Emperor Khang-Hi, in one of his expeditions into Mongolia,
adopted it as a hunting ground.&nbsp; He repaired thither every
year, and his successors regularly followed his example, down to
<i>Kia-King</i>, who, upon a hunting excursion, was killed by
lightning at <i>Ge-ho-Eul</i>.&nbsp; There has been no imperial
hunting there since that time&mdash;now twenty-seven years
ago.&nbsp; <i>Tao-Kouang</i>, son and successor of
<i>Kia-King</i>, being persuaded that a fatality impends over the
exercise of the chase, since his accession to the throne has
never set foot in <i>Ge-ho-Eul</i>, which may be regarded as the
Versailles of the Chinese potentates.&nbsp; The forest, however,
and the animals which inhabit it, have been no gainers by the
circumstance.&nbsp; Despite the penalty of perpetual exile
decreed against all who shall be found, with arms in their hands,
in the forest, it is always half full of poachers and
woodcutters.&nbsp; Gamekeepers, indeed, are stationed at
intervals throughout the forest; but they seem there merely for
the purpose of enjoying a monopoly of the sale of game and
wood.&nbsp; They let any one steal either, provided they
themselves get the larger share of the booty.&nbsp; The poachers
are in especial force from the fourth to the seventh moon.&nbsp;
At this period, the antlers of the stags send forth new shoots,
which contain a sort of half-coagulated blood, called
<i>Lou-joung</i>, which plays a distinguished part in the Chinese
<i>Materia Medica</i>, for its supposed chemical qualities, and
fetches accordingly an exorbitant price.&nbsp; A <i>Lou-joung</i>
sometimes sells for as much as a hundred and fifty ounces of
silver.</p>
<p>Deer of all kinds abound in the forest; and tigers, bears,
wild boars, panthers, and wolves are scarcely less
numerous.&nbsp; Woe to the hunters and wood-cutters who venture
otherwise than in large parties into the recesses of the forest;
they disappear, leaving no vestige behind.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>The fear of encountering one of these wild beasts kept
us from prolonging our walk.&nbsp; Besides, night was setting in,
and we hastened back to our tent.&nbsp; Our first slumber in the
desert was peaceful, and next morning early, after a breakfast of
oatmeal steeped in tea, we resumed our march along the great
<i>Plateau</i>.&nbsp; We soon reached the great <i>Obo</i>,
whither the Tartars resort to worship the Spirit of the
Mountain.&nbsp; The monument is simply an enormous pile of
stones, heaped up without any order, and surmounted with dried
branches of trees, from which hang bones and strips of cloth, on
which are inscribed verses in the Thibet and Mongol
languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p25.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>At its base is a large granite urn in which the devotees burn
incense.&nbsp; They offer, besides, pieces of money, which the
next Chinese passenger, after sundry ceremonious genuflexions
before the Obo, carefully collects and pockets for his own
particular benefit.</p>
<p>These Obos, which occur so frequently throughout Tartary, and
which are the objects of constant pilgrimages on the part of the
Mongols, remind one of the <i>loca excelsa</i> denounced by the
Jewish prophets.</p>
<p>It was near noon before the ground, beginning to slope,
intimated that we approached the termination of the
plateau.&nbsp; We then descended rapidly into a deep valley,
where we found a small Mongolian encampment, which we passed
without pausing, and set up our tent for the night on the margin
of a pool further on.&nbsp; We <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>were now in
the kingdom of Gechekten, an undulating country, well watered,
with abundance of fuel and pasturage, but desolated by bands of
robbers.&nbsp; The Chinese, who have long since taken possession
of it, have rendered it a sort of general refuge for malefactors;
so that &ldquo;man of Gechekten&rdquo; has become a synonyme for
a person without fear of God or man, who will commit any murder,
and shrink from no crime.&nbsp; It would seem as though, in this
country, nature resented the encroachments of man upon her
rights.&nbsp; Wherever the plough has passed, the soil has become
poor, arid, and sandy, producing nothing but oats, which
constitute the food of the people.&nbsp; In the whole district
there is but one trading town, which the Mongols call
<i>Altan-Som&eacute;</i>, (Temple of Gold).&nbsp; This was at
first a great Lamasery, containing nearly 2000 Lamas.&nbsp; By
degrees Chinese have settled there, in order to traffic with the
Tartars.&nbsp; In 1843, when we had occasion to visit this place,
it had already acquired the importance of a town.&nbsp; A
highway, commencing at <i>Altan-Som&eacute;</i>, proceeds towards
the north, and after traversing the country of the
<i>Khalkhas</i>, the river <i>Keroulan</i>, and the
<i>Khinggan</i> mountains, reaches Nertechink, a town of
Siberia.</p>
<p>The sun had just set, and we were occupied inside the tent
boiling our tea, when Arsalan warned us, by his barking, of the
approach of some stranger.&nbsp; We soon heard the trot of a
horse, and presently a mounted Tartar appeared at the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Mendou</i>,&rdquo; he exclaimed, by way of respectful
salutation to the supposed Lamas, raising his joined hands at the
same time to his forehead.&nbsp; When we invited him to drink a
cup of tea with us, he fastened his horse to one of the
tent-pegs, and seated himself by the hearth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs
Lamas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;under what quarter of the heavens
were you born?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are from the western
heaven; and you, whence come you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor
abode is towards the north, at the end of the valley you see
there on our right.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your country is a fine
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mongol shook his head sadly, and made
no reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; we proceeded, after a
moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;the Land of Grass is still very
extensive in the kingdom of Gechekten.&nbsp; Would it not be
better to cultivate your plains?&nbsp; What good are these bare
lands to you?&nbsp; Would not fine crops of corn be preferable to
mere grass?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, with a tone of deep and
settled conviction, &ldquo;We Mongols are formed for living in
tents, and pasturing cattle.&nbsp; So long as we kept to that in
the kingdom of Gechekten, we were rich and happy.&nbsp; Now, ever
since the Mongols have set themselves to cultivating the land,
and building houses, they have become poor.&nbsp; The
<i>Kitats</i> (Chinese) have taken possession of the country;
flocks, herds, lands, houses, all have passed into their
hands.&nbsp; There remain to us only a few prairies, on which
still live, under their tents, such of the <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Mongols as
have not been forced by utter destitution to emigrate to other
lands.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But if the Chinese are so baneful to
you, why did you let them penetrate into your
country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your words are the words of truth,
Sirs Lamas; but you are aware that the Mongols are men of simple
hearts.&nbsp; We took pity on these wicked <i>Kitats</i>, who
came to us weeping, to solicit our charity.&nbsp; We allowed
them, through pure compassion, to cultivate a few patches of
land.&nbsp; The Mongols insensibly followed their example, and
abandoned the nomadic life.&nbsp; They drank the wine of the
Kitats, and smoked their tobacco, on credit; they bought their
manufactures on credit at double the real value.&nbsp; When the
day of payment came there was no money ready, and the Mongols had
to yield, to the violence of their creditors, houses, lands,
flocks, everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But could you not seek
justice from the tribunals?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Justice from the
tribunals!&nbsp; Oh, that is out of the question.&nbsp; The
Kitats are skilful to talk and to lie.&nbsp; It is impossible for
a Mongol to gain a suit against a Kitat.&nbsp; Sirs Lamas, the
kingdom of Gechekten is undone!&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, the poor
Mongol rose, bowed, mounted his horse, and rapidly disappeared in
the desert.</p>
<p>We travelled two more days through this kingdom, and
everywhere witnessed the poverty and wretchedness of its
scattered inhabitants.&nbsp; Yet the country is naturally endowed
with astonishing wealth, especially in gold and silver mines,
which of themselves have occasioned many of its worst
calamities.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the rigorous prohibition to
work these mines, it sometimes happens that large bands of
Chinese outlaws assemble together, and march, sword in hand, to
dig into them.&nbsp; These are men professing to be endowed with
a peculiar capacity for discovering the precious metals, guided,
according to their own account, by the conformation of mountains,
and the sorts of plants they produce.&nbsp; One single man,
possessed of this fatal gift, will suffice to spread desolation
over a whole district.&nbsp; He speedily finds himself at the
head of thousands and thousands of outcasts, who overspread the
country, and render it the theatre of every crime.&nbsp; While
some are occupied in working the mines others pillage the
surrounding districts, sparing neither persons nor property, and
committing excesses which the imagination could not conceive, and
which continue until some mandarin, powerful and courageous
enough to suppress them, is brought within their operation, and
takes measures against them accordingly.</p>
<p>Calamities of this nature have frequently desolated the
kingdom of Gechekten; but none of them are comparable with what
happened in the kingdom of Ouniot, in 1841.&nbsp; A Chinese
<i>mine discoverer</i>, having ascertained the presence of gold
in a particular mountain, announced the discovery, and robbers
and vagabonds <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>at once congregated around him, from
far and near, to the number of 12,000.&nbsp; This hideous mob put
the whole country under subjection, and exercised for two years
its fearful sway.&nbsp; Almost the entire mountain passed through
the crucible, and such enormous quantities of metal were
produced, that the price of gold fell in China fifty per
cent.&nbsp; The inhabitants complained incessantly to the Chinese
mandarins, but in vain; for these worthies only interfere where
they can do so with some benefit to themselves.&nbsp; The King of
Ouniot himself feared to measure his strength with such an army
of desperadoes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p28.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>One day, however, the Queen of Ouniot, repairing on a
pilgrimage to the tomb of her ancestors, had to pass the valley
in which the army of miners was assembled.&nbsp; Her car was
surrounded; she was rudely compelled to alight, and it was only
upon the sacrifice <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>of her jewels that she was permitted
to proceed.&nbsp; Upon her return home, she reproached the King
bitterly for his cowardice.&nbsp; At length, stung by her words,
he assembled the troops of his two banners, and marched against
the miners.&nbsp; The engagement which ensued was for a while
doubtful; but at length the miners were driven in by the Tartar
cavalry, who massacred them without mercy.&nbsp; The bulk of the
survivors took refuge in the mine.&nbsp; The Mongols blocked up
the apertures with huge stones.&nbsp; The cries of the despairing
wretches within were heard for a few days, and then ceased for
ever.&nbsp; Those of the miners who were taken alive had their
eyes put out, and were then dismissed.</p>
<p>We had just quitted the kingdom of Gechekten, and entered that
of Thakar, when we came to a military encampment, where were
stationed a party of Chinese soldiers charged with the
preservation of the public safety.&nbsp; The hour of repose had
arrived; but these soldiers, instead of giving us confidence by
their presence, increased, on the contrary, our fears; for we
knew that they were themselves the most daring robbers in the
whole district.&nbsp; We turned aside, therefore, and ensconced
ourselves between two rocks, where we found just space enough for
our tent.&nbsp; We had scarcely set up our temporary abode, when
we observed, in the distance, on the slope of the mountains, a
numerous body of horsemen at full gallop.&nbsp; Their rapid but
irregular evolutions seemed to indicate that they were pursuing
something which constantly evaded them.&nbsp; By-and-by, two of
the horsemen, perceiving us, dashed up to our tent, dismounted,
and threw themselves on the ground at the door.&nbsp; They were
Tartar-Mongols.&nbsp; &ldquo;Men of prayer,&rdquo; said they,
with voices full of emotion, &ldquo;we come to ask you to draw
our horoscope.&nbsp; We have this day had two horses stolen from
us.&nbsp; We have fruitlessly sought traces of the robbers, and
we therefore come to you, men whose power and learning is beyond
all limit, to tell us where we shall find our
property.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;we
are not Lamas of Buddha; we do not believe in horoscopes.&nbsp;
For a man to say that he can, by any such means, discover that
which is stolen, is for them to put forth the words of falsehood
and deception.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor Tartars redoubled their
solicitations; but when they found that we were inflexible in our
resolution, they remounted their horses, in order to return to
the mountains.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba, meanwhile, had been silent, apparently paying
no attention to the incident, but fixed at the fire-place, with
his bowl of tea to his lips.&nbsp; All of a sudden he knitted his
brows, rose, and came to the door.&nbsp; The horsemen were at
some distance; but the Dchiahour, by an exertion of his strong
lungs, induced them to turn round in their saddles.&nbsp; He
motioned to them, and they, supposing <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>we had
relented, and were willing to draw the desired horoscope,
galloped once more towards us.&nbsp; When they had come within
speaking distance:&mdash;&ldquo;My Mongol brothers,&rdquo; cried
Samdadchiemba, &ldquo;in future be more careful; watch your herds
well, and you won&rsquo;t be robbed.&nbsp; Retain these words of
mine on your memory: they are worth all the horoscopes in the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this friendly address, he gravely
re-entered the tent, and seating himself at the hearth, resumed
his tea.</p>
<p>We were at first somewhat disconcerted by this singular
proceeding; but as the horsemen themselves did not take the
matter in ill part, but quietly rode off, we burst into a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stupid Mongols!&rdquo; grumbled
Samdadchiemba; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t give themselves the
trouble to watch their animals, and then, when they are stolen
from them, they run about wanting people to draw horoscopes for
them.&nbsp; After all, perhaps, it&rsquo;s no wonder, for nobody
but ourselves tells them the truth.&nbsp; The Lamas encourage
them in their credulity; for they turn it into a source of
income.&nbsp; It is difficult to deal with such people.&nbsp; If
you tell them you can&rsquo;t draw a horoscope, they don&rsquo;t
believe you, and merely suppose you don&rsquo;t choose to oblige
them.&nbsp; To get rid of them, the best way is to give them an
answer haphazard.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here Samdadchiemba laughed
with such expansion, that his little eyes were completely
buried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever draw a horoscope?&rdquo; asked
we.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied he still laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was very young at the time, not more than fifteen.&nbsp;
I was travelling through the Red Banner of Thakar, when I was
addressed by some Mongols who led me into their tent.&nbsp; There
they entreated me to tell them, by means of divination, where a
bull had strayed, which had been missing three days.&nbsp; It was
to no purpose that I protested to them I could not perform
divination, that I could not even read.&nbsp; &lsquo;You deceive
us,&rsquo; said they; &lsquo;you are a <i>Dchiahour</i>, and we
know that the Western Lamas can all divine more or
less.&rsquo;&nbsp; As the only way of extricating myself from the
dilemma, I resolved to imitate what I had seen the Lamas do in
their divinations.&nbsp; I directed one person to collect eleven
sheep&rsquo;s droppings, the dryest he could find.&nbsp; They
were immediately brought.&nbsp; I then seated myself very
gravely; I counted the droppings over and over; I arranged them
in rows, and then counted them again; I rolled them up and down
in threes; and then appeared to meditate.&nbsp; At last I said to
the Mongols, who were impatiently awaiting the result of the
horoscope: &lsquo;If you would find your bull, go seek him
towards the north.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before the words were well out of
my mouth, four men were on horseback, galloping off towards the
north.&nbsp; By the most curious chance in the world, they had
not proceeded far, before the missing animal made its appearance,
quietly browzing.&nbsp; I at once got the character <!-- page
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of a
diviner of the first class, was entertained in the most liberal
manner for a week, and when I departed had a stock of butter and
tea given me enough for another week.&nbsp; Now that I belong to
Holy Church, I know that these things are wicked and prohibited;
otherwise I would have given these horsemen a word or two of
horoscope, which perhaps would have procured for us, in return, a
good cup of tea with butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stolen horses confirmed in our minds the ill reputation of
the country in which we were now encamped; and we felt ourselves
necessitated to take additional precaution.&nbsp; Before
night-fall we brought in the horse and the mule, and fastened
them by cords to pins at the door of our tent, and made the
camels kneel by their side, so as to close up the entrance.&nbsp;
By this arrangement no one could get near us without our having
full warning given us by the camels, which, at the least noise,
always make an outcry loud enough to awaken the deepest
sleeper.&nbsp; Finally, having suspended from one of the
tent-poles our travelling lantern, which we kept burning all the
night, we endeavoured to obtain a little repose, but in vain; the
night passed away, without our getting a wink of sleep.&nbsp; As
to the <i>Dchiahour</i>, whom nothing ever troubled, we heard him
snoring with all the might of his lungs until daybreak.</p>
<p>We made our preparations for departure very early, for we were
eager to quit this ill-famed place, and to reach
<i>Tolon-Noor</i>, which was now distant only a few leagues.</p>
<p>On our way thither, a horseman stopped his galloping steed,
and, after looking at us for a moment, addressed us: &ldquo;You
are the chiefs of the Christians of the Contiguous
Defiles?&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon our replying in the affirmative, he
dashed off again; but turned his head once or twice, to have
another look at us.&nbsp; He was a Mongol, who had charge of some
herds at the Contiguous Defiles.&nbsp; He had often seen us
there; but the novelty of our present costume at first prevented
his recognising us.&nbsp; We met also the Tartars who, the day
before, had asked us to draw a horoscope for them.&nbsp; They had
repaired by daybreak, to the horse-fair at <i>Tolon-Noor</i>, in
the hope of finding their stolen animals; but their search had
been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The increasing number of travellers, Tartars and Chinese, whom
we now met, indicated the approach to the great town of
<i>Tolon-Noor</i>.&nbsp; We already saw in the distance,
glittering under the sun&rsquo;s rays, the gilt roofs of two
magnificent Lamaseries that stand in the northern suburbs of the
town.&nbsp; We journeyed for some time through a succession of
cemeteries; for here, as elsewhere, the present generation is
surrounded by the ornamental sepulchres of past
generations.&nbsp; As we observed the numerous population of that
large town, environed as it were by a vast circle of bones and
monumental stones, <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>it seemed as though death was
continuously engaged in the blockade of life.&nbsp; Here and
there, in the vast cemetery which completely encircles the city,
we remarked little gardens, where, by dint of extreme labour, a
few miserable vegetables were extracted from the earth: leeks,
spinach, hard bitter lettuces, and cabbages, which, introduced
some years since from Russia, have adapted themselves exceedingly
well to the climate of Northern China.</p>
<p>With the exception of these few esculents, the environs of
<i>Tolon-Noor</i> produce absolutely nothing whatever.&nbsp; The
soil is dry and sandy, and water terribly scarce.&nbsp; It is
only here and there that a few limited springs are found, and
these are dried up in the hot season.</p>

<p>Our entrance into the city of Tolon-Noor was fatiguing and
full of perplexity; for we knew not where to take up our
abode.&nbsp; We wandered about for a long time in a labyrinth of
narrow, tortuous streets, encumbered with men and animals and
goods.&nbsp; At last we found an inn.&nbsp; We unloaded our
dromedaries, deposited the baggage in small room, foddered the
animals, and then, having affixed to the door of our room the
padlock which, as is the custom, our landlord gave us for that
purpose, we sallied forth in quest of dinner.&nbsp; A triangular
flag floating before a house in the next <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>street,
indicated to our joyful hearts an eating-house.&nbsp; A long
passage led us into a spacious apartment, in which were
symmetrically set forth a number of little tables.&nbsp; Seating
ourselves at one of these, a tea-pot, the inevitable prelude in
these countries to every meal, was set before each of us.&nbsp;
You must swallow infinite tea, and that boiling hot, before they
will consent to bring you anything else.&nbsp; At last, when they
see you thus occupied, the Comptroller of the Table pays you his
official visit, a personage of immensely elegant manners, and
ceaseless volubility of tongue, who, after entertaining you with
his views upon the affairs of the world in general, and each
country in particular, concludes by announcing what there is to
eat, and requesting your judgment thereupon.&nbsp; As you mention
the dishes you desire, he repeats their names in a measured
chant, for the information of the Governor of the Pot.&nbsp; Your
dinner is served up with admirable promptitude; but before you
commence the meal, etiquette requires that you rise from your
seat, and invite all the other company present to partake.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; you say, with an engaging gesture,
&ldquo;come my friends, come and drink a glass of wine with me;
come and eat a plate of rice;&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
thank you,&rdquo; replies every body; &ldquo;do you rather come
and seat yourself at my table.&nbsp; It is I who invite
you;&rdquo; and so the matter ends.&nbsp; By this ceremony you
have &ldquo;manifested your honour,&rdquo; as the phrase runs,
and you may now sit down and eat it in comfort, your character as
a gentleman perfectly established.</p>
<p>When you rise to depart, the Comptroller of the Table again
appears.&nbsp; As you cross the apartment with him, he chants
over again the names of the dishes you have had, this time
appending the prices, and terminating with the sum total,
announced with especial emphasis, which, proceeding to the
counter, you then deposit in the money-box.&nbsp; In general, the
Chinese restaurateurs are quite as skilful as those of France in
exciting the vanity of the guests, and promoting the consumption
of their commodities.</p>
<p>Two motives had induced us to direct our steps, in the first
instance, to Tolon-Noor: we desired to make more purchases there
to complete our travelling equipment, and, secondly, it appeared
to us necessary to place ourselves in communication with the
Lamas of the country, in order to obtain information from them as
to the more important localities of Tartary.&nbsp; The purchases
we needed to make gave us occasion to visit the different
quarters of the town.&nbsp; Tolon-Noor (Seven Lakes) is called by
the Chinese <i>Lama-Miao</i> (Convent of Lamas).&nbsp; The
Mantchous designate it <i>Nadan-Omo</i>, and the Thibetians,
<i>Tsot-Dun</i>, both translations of Tolon-Noor, and, equally
with it, meaning &ldquo;Seven Lakes.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>On
the map published by M. Andriveau-Goujon, <a
name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a> this town is called
<i>Djo-Naiman-Soum&eacute;</i>, which in Mongol means, &ldquo;The
Hundred and Eight Convents.&rdquo;&nbsp; This name is perfectly
unknown in the country itself.</p>
<p>Tolon-Noor is not a walled city, but a vast agglomeration of
hideous houses, which seem to have been thrown together with a
pitchfork.&nbsp; The carriage portion of the streets is a marsh
of mud and putrid filth, deep enough to stifle and bury the
smaller beasts of burden that not unfrequently fall within it,
and whose carcases remain to aggravate the general stench; while
their loads become the prey of the innumerable thieves who are
ever on the alert.&nbsp; The foot-path is a narrow, rugged,
slippery line on either side, just wide enough to admit the
passage of one person.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the nastiness of the town itself, the sterility
of the environs, the excessive cold of its winter, and the
intolerable heat of its summer, its population is immense, and
its commerce enormous.&nbsp; Russian merchandise is brought
hither in large quantities by the way of Kiakta.&nbsp; The
Tartars bring incessant herds of camels, oxen, and horses, and
carry back in exchange tobacco, linen, and tea.&nbsp; This
constant arrival and departure of strangers communicates to the
city an animated and varied aspect.&nbsp; All sorts of hawkers
are at every corner offering their petty wares; the regular
traders, from behind their counters, invite, with honeyed words
and tempting offers, the passers-by to come in and buy.&nbsp; The
Lamas, in their red and yellow robes, gallop up and down, seeking
admiration for their equestrianism, and the skilful management of
their fiery steeds.</p>
<p>The trade of Tolon-Noor is mostly in the hands of men from the
province of <i>Chan-Si</i>, who seldom establish themselves
permanently in the town; but after a few years, when their
money-chest is filled, return to their own country.&nbsp; In this
vast emporium, the Chinese invariably make fortunes, and the
Tartars invariably are ruined.&nbsp; Tolon-Noor, in fact, is a
sort of great pneumatic pump, constantly at work in emptying the
pockets of the unlucky Mongols.</p>
<p>The magnificent statues, in bronze and brass, which issue from
the great foundries of Tolon-Noor, are celebrated not only
throughout Tartary, but in the remotest districts of
Thibet.&nbsp; Its immense workshops supply all the countries
subject to the worship of Buddha with idols, bells, and vases
employed in that idolatry.&nbsp; While we were in the town, a
monster statue of Buddha, a present <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>from a friend
of Oudchou-Mourdchin to the Tal&egrave;-Lama, was packed for
Thibet, on the backs of six camels.&nbsp; The larger statues are
cast in detail, the component parts being afterwards soldered
together.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We availed ourselves of our stay at Tolon-Noor to have a
figure of Christ constructed on the model of a bronze original
which we had brought with us from France.&nbsp; The workmen so
marvellously excelled, that it was difficult to distinguish the
copy from the original.&nbsp; The Chinese work more rapidly and
cheaply, and their complaisance contrasts most favourably with
the tenacious self-opinion of their brethren in Europe.</p>
<p>During our stay at Tolon-Noor, we had frequent occasion to
visit the Lamaseries, or Lama monasteries, and to converse with
the idolatrous priests of Buddhism.&nbsp; The Lamas appeared to
us persons of very limited information; and as to their
symbolism, in general, it is little more refined or purer than
the creed of the vulgar.&nbsp; Their doctrine is still undecided,
fluctuating amidst a vast fanaticism of which they can give no
intelligible account.&nbsp; When we asked them for some distinct,
clear, positive idea what they meant, they were always thrown
into utter embarrassment, and <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>stared at one
another.&nbsp; The disciples told us that their masters knew all
about it; the masters referred us to the omniscience of the Grand
Lamas; the Grand Lamas confessed themselves ignorant, but talked
of some wonderful saint, in some Lamasery at the other end of the
country: <i>he</i> could explain the whole affair.&nbsp; However,
all of them, disciples and masters, great Lamas and small, agreed
in this, that their doctrine came from the West.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
nearer you approach the West,&rdquo; said they unanimously,
&ldquo;the purer and more luminous will the doctrine manifest
itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we expounded to them the truths of
Christianity, they never discussed the matter; they contented
themselves with calmly saying, &ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t
suppose that our prayers are the only prayers in the world.&nbsp;
The Lamas of the West will explain everything to you.&nbsp; We
believe in the traditions that have come from the
West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In point of fact there is no Lamasery of any importance in
Tartary, the Grand Lama or superior of which is not a man from
Thibet.&nbsp; Any Tartar Lama who has visited <i>Lha-Ssa</i>
[Land of Spirits], or <i>Monhe-Dhot</i> [Eternal Sanctuary], as
it is called in the Mongol dialect, is received, on his return,
as a man to whom the mysteries of the past and of the future have
been unveiled.</p>
<p>After maturely weighing the information we had obtained from
the Lamas, it was decided that we should direct our steps towards
the West.&nbsp; On October 1st we quitted Tolon-Noor; and it was
not without infinite trouble that we managed to traverse the
filthy town with our camels.&nbsp; The poor animals could only
get through the quagmire streets by fits and starts; it was first
a stumble, then a convulsive jump, then another stumble and
another jump, and so on.&nbsp; Their loads shook on their backs,
and at every step we expected to see the camel and camel-load
prostrate in the mud.&nbsp; We considered ourselves lucky when,
at distant intervals, we came to a comparatively dry spot, where
the camels could travel, and we were thus enabled to re-adjust
and tighten the baggage.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba got into a desperate
ill temper; he went on, and slipped, and went on again, without
uttering a single word, restricting the visible manifestation of
his wrath to a continuous biting of the lips.</p>
<p>Upon attaining at length the western extremity of the town, we
got clear of the filth indeed, but found ourselves involved in
another evil.&nbsp; Before us there was no road marked out, not
the slightest trace of even a path.&nbsp; There was nothing but
an apparently interminable chain of small hills, composed of
fine, moving sand, over which it was impossible to advance at
more than a snail&rsquo;s pace, and this only with extreme
labour.&nbsp; Among these sand-hills, moreover, we were oppressed
with an absolutely stifling heat.&nbsp; Our <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>animals were
covered with perspiration, ourselves devoured with a burning
thirst; but it was in vain that we looked round in all
directions, as we proceeded, for water; not a spring, not a pool,
not a drop presented itself.</p>
<p>It was already late, and we began to fear we should find no
spot favourable for the erection of our tent.&nbsp; The ground,
however, grew by degrees firmer, and we at last discerned some
signs of vegetation.&nbsp; By-and-by, the sand almost
disappeared, and our eyes were rejoiced with the sight of
continuous verdure.&nbsp; On our left, at no great distance, we
saw the opening of a defile.&nbsp; M. Gabet urged on his camel,
and went to examine the spot.&nbsp; He soon made his appearance
at the summit of a hill, and with voice and hand directed us to
follow him.&nbsp; We hastened on, and found that Providence had
led us to a favourable position.&nbsp; A small pool, the waters
of which were half concealed by thick reeds and other marshy
vegetation, some brushwood, a plot of grass: what could we under
the circumstances desire more?&nbsp; Hungry, thirsty, weary as we
were, the place seemed a perfect Eden.</p>
<p>The camels were no sooner squatted, than we all three, with
one accord, and without a word said, seized, each man his wooden
cup, and rushed to the pond to satisfy his thirst.&nbsp; The
water was fresh enough; but it affected the nose violently with
its strong muriatic odour.&nbsp; I remembered to have drunk water
just like it in the Pyrenees, at the good town of Ax, and to have
seen it for sale in the chemists&rsquo; shops elsewhere in
France: and I remembered, further, that by reason of its being
particularly stinking and particularly nasty, it was sold there
at fifteen sous per bottle.</p>
<p>After having quenched our thirst, our strength by degrees
returned, and we were then able to fix our tent, and each man to
set about his especial task.&nbsp; M. Gabet proceeded to cut some
bundles of horn-beam wood; Samdadchiemba collected argols in the
flap of his jacket; and M. Huc, seated at the entrance of the
tent, tried his hand at drawing a fowl, a process which Arsalan,
stretched at his side, watched with greedy eye, having immediate
reference to the entrails in course of removal.&nbsp; We were
resolved, for once and away, to have a little festival in the
desert; and to take the opportunity to indulge our patriotism by
initiating our <i>Dchiahour</i> in the luxury of a dish prepared
according to the rules of the <i>cuisinier
Fran&ccedil;ais</i>.&nbsp; The fowl, artistically dismembered,
was placed at the bottom of our great pot.&nbsp; A few roots of
synapia, prepared in salt water, some onions, a clove of garlic,
and some allspice, constituted the seasoning.&nbsp; The
preparation was soon boiling, for we were that day rich in
fuel.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba, by-and-by, plunged his hand into the
pot, drew out a limb of the fowl, and, after <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>carefully
inspecting it, pronounced supper to be ready.&nbsp; The pot was
taken from the trivet, and placed upon the grass.&nbsp; We all
three seated ourselves around it, so that our knees almost
touched it, and each, armed with two chopsticks, fished out the
pieces he desired from the abundant broth before him.</p>
<p>When the meal was completed, and we had thanked God for the
repast he had thus provided us with in the desert, Samdadchiemba
went and washed the cauldron in the pond.&nbsp; That done, he
brewed us some tea.&nbsp; The tea used by the Tartars is not
prepared in the same way as that consumed by the Chinese.&nbsp;
The latter, it is known, merely employ the smaller and tenderer
leaves of the plant, which they simply infuse in boiling water,
so as to give it a golden tint; the coarser leaves, with which
are mixed up the smaller tendrils, are pressed together in a
mould, in the form and of the size of the ordinary house
brick.&nbsp; Thus prepared, it becomes an article of considerable
commerce, under the designation of Tartar-tea, the Tartars being
its exclusive consumers, with the exception of the Russians, who
drink great quantities of it.&nbsp; When required for use, a
piece of the brick is broken off, pulverised, and boiled in the
kettle, until the water assumes a reddish hue.&nbsp; Some salt is
then thrown in, and effervescence commences.&nbsp; When the
liquid has become almost black, milk is added, and the beverage,
the grand luxury of the Tartars, is then transferred to the
tea-pot.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba was a perfect enthusiast of this
tea.&nbsp; For our parts, we drank it in default of something
better.</p>
<p>Next morning, after rolling up our tent, we quitted this
asylum without regret indeed, for we had selected and occupied it
altogether without preference.&nbsp; However, before departing,
we set up, as an <i>ex-voto</i> of our gratitude for its
reception of us for a night, a small wooden cross, on the site of
our fire-place, and this precedent we afterwards followed, at all
our encamping places.&nbsp; Could missionaries leave a more
appropriate memorial of their journey through the desert!</p>
<p>We had not advanced an hour&rsquo;s journey on our way, when
we heard behind us the trampling of many horses, and the confused
sound of many voices.&nbsp; We looked back, and saw hastening in
our direction a numerous caravan.&nbsp; Three horsemen soon
overtook us, one of whom, whose costume bespoke him a Tartar
mandarin, addressed us with a loud voice, &ldquo;Sirs, where is
your country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We come from the
west.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Through what districts has your
beneficial shadow passed?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have last come
from Tolon-Noor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Has peace accompanied your
progress?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hitherto we have journeyed in all
tranquillity.&nbsp; And you: are you at peace?&nbsp; And what is
your country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are Khalkhas, of the kingdom
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>of Mourguevan.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have the rains been
abundant?&nbsp; Are your flocks and herds
flourishing?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All goes well in our
pasture-grounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whither proceeds your
caravan?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We go to incline our foreheads
before the Five Towers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rest of the caravan had
joined us in the course of this abrupt and hurried
conversation.&nbsp; We were on the banks of a small stream,
bordered with brushwood.&nbsp; The chief of the caravan ordered a
halt, and the camels formed, as each came up, a circle, in the
centre of which was drawn up a close carriage upon four
wheels.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sok! sok!&rsquo; cried the camel drivers,
and at the word, and as with one motion, the entire circle of
intelligent animals knelt.&nbsp; While numerous tents, taken from
their backs, were set up, as it were, by enchantment, two
mandarins, decorated with the blue button, approached the
carriages, opened the door, and handed out a Tartar lady, covered
with a long silk robe.&nbsp; She was the Queen of the Khalkhas
repairing in pilgrimage to the famous Lamasery of the Five
Towers, in the province of <i>Chan-Si</i>.&nbsp; When she saw us,
she saluted us with the ordinary form of raising both her hands:
&ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is this place
auspicious for an encampment?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Royal Pilgrim
of Mourguevan,&rdquo; we replied, &ldquo;you may light your fires
here in all security.&nbsp; For ourselves, we must proceed on our
way, for the sun was already high when we folded our
tent.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so saying, we took our leave of the
Tartars of Mourguevan.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p40.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=
"Queen of Mourguevan"
title=
"Queen of Mourguevan"

</a>Our minds were deeply excited upon beholding this queen and
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>her numerous suite performing this long pilgrimage
through the desert: no danger, no distance, no expense, no
privation deters the Mongols from their prosecution.&nbsp; The
Mongols are, indeed, an essentially religious people; with them
the future life is everything; the things of this world
nothing.&nbsp; They live in the world as though they were not of
it; they cultivate no lands, they build no houses; they regard
themselves as foreigners travelling through life; and this
feeling, deep and universal, developes itself in the practical
form of incessant journeys.</p>
<p>The taste for pilgrimages which, at all periods of the
world&rsquo;s history, has manifested itself in religious people,
is a thing worthy of earnest attention.&nbsp; The worship of the
true God led the Jews, several times a year, to Jerusalem.&nbsp;
In profane antiquity, those who took any heed to religious belief
at all repaired to Egypt, in order to be initiated in the
mysteries of Osiris, and to seek lessons of wisdom from his
priests.&nbsp; It was to travellers that the mysterious sphynx of
Mount Phic&aelig;us proposed the profound enigma of which
&OElig;dipus discovered the solution.&nbsp; In the middle ages,
the spirit of pilgrimage held predominant sway in Europe, and the
Christians of that epoch were full of fervour for this species of
devotion.&nbsp; The Turks, while they were yet believers,
repaired to Mecca in great caravans; and in our travels in
Central Asia, we constantly met numerous pilgrims going to or
fro, all of them profoundly filled with and earnestly impelled by
a sincere sentiment of religion.&nbsp; It is to be remarked that
pilgrimages have diminished in Europe, in proportion as faith has
become rationalist, and as people have taken to discuss the
truths of religion.&nbsp; Wherever faith remains earnest, simple,
unquestioning, in the breasts of men, these pilgrimages are in
vigour.&nbsp; The reason is, that the intensity of simple faith
creates a peculiarly profound and energetic feeling of the
condition of man, as a wayfarer upon the earth; and it is natural
that this feeling should manifest itself in pious
wayfarings.&nbsp; Indeed, the Catholic Church, which is the
depository of all truth, has introduced processions into the
liturgy, as a memorial of pilgrimages, and to remind men that
this earth is a desert, wherein we commence, with our birth, the
awful journey of eternity.</p>
<p>We had left far behind us the pilgrims of Mourguevan, and
began to regret that we had not encamped in their company upon
the banks of the pleasant stream, and amid the fat pastures which
it fed.&nbsp; Sensations of fear grew upon us, as we saw great
clouds arise in the horizon, spread, and gradually obscure the
sky.&nbsp; We looked anxiously around, in all directions, for a
place in which we could commodiously halt for the night, but we
saw no indication whatever of water.&nbsp; While we were deep in
this perplexity, some <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>large drops of rain told us that we
had no time to lose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us make haste, and set up
the tent,&rdquo; cried Samdadchiemba vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
need not trouble yourselves any more in looking for water; you
will have water enough presently.&nbsp; Let us get under shelter
before the sky falls on our heads.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is
all very well,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;but we must have some water
for the animals and ourselves to drink.&nbsp; You alone require a
bucket of water for your tea every evening.&nbsp; Where shall we
find some water?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My fathers, you will very
speedily have more water than you like.&nbsp; Let us encamp,
that&rsquo;s the first thing to be done.&nbsp; As to thirst, no
one will need to die of that this evening: dig but a few holes
about the tent, and they&rsquo;ll soon overflow with
rain-water.&nbsp; But we need not even dig holes,&rdquo; added
Samdadchiemba, extending his right hand; &ldquo;do you see that
shepherd there and his flock?&nbsp; You may be sure water is not
far off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Following with our eyes the direction of
his finger, we perceived in a lateral valley a man driving a
large flock of sheep.&nbsp; We immediately turned aside, and
hastened after the man.&nbsp; The rain which now began to fall in
torrents redoubled our celerity.&nbsp; To aggravate our distress,
the lading of one of the camels just at this moment became loose,
and slipped right round towards the ground, and we had to wait
while the camel knelt, and Samdadchiemba readjusted the baggage
on its back.&nbsp; We were, consequently, thoroughly wet through
before we reached a small lake, now agitated and swollen by the
falling torrent.&nbsp; There was no occasion for deliberating
that evening as to the particular site on which we should set up
our tent; selection was out of the question, when the ground all
about was deeply saturated with the rain.</p>
<p>The violence of the rain itself mitigated; but the wind
absolutely raged.&nbsp; We had infinite trouble to unroll our
miserable tents, heavy and impracticable with wet, like a large
sheet just taken from the washing-tub.&nbsp; The difficulty
seemed insuperable when we attempted to stretch it upon its
poles, and we should never have succeeded at all, but for the
extraordinary muscular power with which Samdadchiemba was
endowed.&nbsp; At length we effected a shelter from the wind, and
from a small cold rain with which it was accompanied.&nbsp; When
our lodging was established, Samdadchiemba addressed us in these
consolatory words:&mdash;&ldquo;My spiritual fathers, I told you
we should not die to-day of thirst; but I am not at all sure that
we don&rsquo;t run some risk of dying of hunger.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
point of fact, there seemed no possibility of making a
fire.&nbsp; There was not a tree, not a shrub, not a root to be
seen.&nbsp; As to argols, they were out of the question; the rain
had long since reduced that combustible of the desert to a liquid
pulp.</p>
<p>We had formed our resolution, and were on the point of making
<!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>a supper of meal steeped in a little cold water, when we
saw approaching us two Tartars, leading a small camel.&nbsp;
After the usual salutations, one of them said: &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,
this day the heavens have fallen; you, doubtless, have been
unable to make a fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! how should we
make a fire, when we have no argols?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Men are
all brothers, and belong each to the other.&nbsp; But laymen
should honour and serve the holy ones; therefore it is that we
have come to make a fire for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The worthy Tartars
had seen us setting up our tent, and conceiving our
embarrassment, had hastened to relieve it by a present of two
bundles of argols.&nbsp; We thanked Providence for this
unexpected succour, and the <i>Dchiahour</i> immediately made a
fire, and set about the preparation of an oatmeal supper.&nbsp;
The quantity was on this occasion augmented in favour of the two
friends who had so opportunely presented themselves.</p>
<p>During our modest repast, we noticed that one of these Tartars
was the object of especial attention on the part of his
comrade.&nbsp; We asked him what military grade he occupied in
the Blue Banner.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the banners of Tchakar marched
two years ago against the Rebels of the South, <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> I held the rank of
Tchouanda.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What! were you in that famous war
of the South?&nbsp; But how is it that you, shepherds of the
plains, have also the courage of soldiers?&nbsp; Accustomed to a
life of peace, one would imagine that you would never be
reconciled to the terrible trade of a soldier, which consists in
killing others or being killed yourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, yes, we are shepherds, it is true; but we never
forget that we are soldiers also, and that the Eight Banners
compose the army of reserve of the Grand Master (the
Emperor).&nbsp; You know the rule of the Empire; when the enemy
appears, they send against them, first&mdash;the <i>Kitat</i>
soldiers; next, the banners of the <i>Solon</i> country are set
in motion.&nbsp; If the war is not finished then, all they have
to do is to give the signal to the banners of the <i>Tchakar</i>,
the mere sound of whose march always suffices to reduce the
rebels to subjection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were all the banners of Tchakar called together for
this southern war?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, all; at first it was
thought a small matter, and every one said that it would never
affect the Tchakar.&nbsp; The troops of Kitat went first, but
they did nothing; the banners of Solon also marched; but they
could not bear the heat of the South;&mdash;then the Emperor sent
us his sacred order.&nbsp; Each man selected his best horse,
removed the dust from his bow and quiver, and scraped the rust
from his lance.&nbsp; In every tent a sheep was killed for the
feast of departure.&nbsp; Women and children wept, but we
addressed to them the words of reason.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,&rsquo;
said we, &lsquo;for <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>six generations have we received the
benefits of the Sacred Master, and he has asked from us nothing
in return.&nbsp; Now that he has need of us can we hold
back?&nbsp; He has given to us the fine region of Tchakar to be a
pasture-land for our cattle, and at the same time a barrier for
him against the Khalkhas.&nbsp; But now, since it is from the
South the rebels came, we must march to the South.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Was not reason in our mouths, Sirs Lamas?&nbsp; Yes, we resolved
to march.&nbsp; The Sacred Ordinance reached us at sun-rise, and
already by noon the <i>Bochehous</i> at the head of their men,
stood by the <i>Tchouanda</i>; next to these were the
<i>Nourou-Tchayn</i>, and then the <i>Ougourda</i>.&nbsp; The
same day we marched to Peking; from Peking they led us to
Tien-Tsin-Vei, where we remained for three months.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you fight,&rdquo; asked Samdadchiemba; &ldquo;did you
see the enemy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, they did not dare to
appear.&nbsp; The Kitat told us everywhere that we were marching
upon certain and unavailing death.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can you
do,&rsquo; asked they, &lsquo;against sea-monsters?&nbsp; They
live in the water like fish.&nbsp; When you least expect them,
they appear on the surface, and hurl their fire-bombs at you; the
instant your bow is bent to shoot them, down they dive like
frogs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they essayed to frighten <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>us;
but we soldiers of the Eight Banners know not fear.&nbsp; Before
our departure the great Lamas had opened the Book of Celestial
Secrets, and had thence learned that the matter would end well
for us.&nbsp; The Emperor had attached to each Tchouanda a Lama,
learned in medicine, and skilled in all the sacred auguries, who
was to cure all the soldiers under him of the diseases of the
climate, and to protect us from the magic of the sea
monsters.&nbsp; What then had we to fear?&nbsp; The rebels,
hearing that the invincible troops of Tchakar were approaching,
were seized with fear, and sought peace.&nbsp; The Sacred Master,
of his immense mercy, granted it, and we returned to the care of
our flocks.&rdquo;</p>

</a>The narrative of this <i>Illustrious Sword</i> was to us full
of intense interest.&nbsp; We forgot for a moment the misery of
our position amid the desert.&nbsp; We were eager to collect
further details of the expedition of the English against China;
but night falling, the two Tartars took their way homeward.</p>
<p>Thus left once more alone, our thoughts became exceedingly sad
and sombre.&nbsp; We shuddered at the idea so recalled to us of
the long night just commencing.&nbsp; How were we to get any
sleep?&nbsp; The interior of the tent was little better than a
mud heap; the great fire we had been keeping up had not half
dried our clothes; it had merely resolved a portion of the water
into a thick vapour that steamed about us.&nbsp; The furs, which
we used at night by way of mattress, were in a deplorable
condition, not a whit better for the purpose than the skin of a
drowned cat.&nbsp; In this doleful condition of things, a
reflection, full of gentle melancholy, came into our minds, and
consoled us; we remembered that we were the disciples of Him who
said, &ldquo;The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We became so fatigued, after remaining awake the greater part
of the night, that sleep conquering us, we fell into a restless
doze, seated over the embers of the fire, our arms crossed, and
our heads bent forward, in the most uncomfortable position
possible.</p>
<p>It was with extreme delight that we hailed the termination of
that long and dreary night.&nbsp; At daybreak, the blue,
cloudless sky, presaged compensation for the wretchedness of the
preceding evening.&nbsp; By-and-by, the sun rising clear and
brilliant, inspired us with the hope that our still wet clothes
would soon get dry as we proceeded on our way.&nbsp; We speedily
made all preparations for departure, and the caravan set
forth.&nbsp; The weather was magnificent.&nbsp; By degrees, the
large grass of the prairie raised its broad head, which had been
depressed by the heavy rain; the ground became firmer, and we
experienced, with delight, the gentle heat of the sun&rsquo;s
ascending rays.&nbsp; At last, to complete our satisfaction, we
entered <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>upon the plains of the Red Banner,
the most picturesque of the whole Tchakar.</p>
<p><i>Tchakar</i> signifies, in the Mongol tongue, <i>Border
Land</i>.&nbsp; This country is limited, on the east by the
kingdom of <i>Gechekten</i>, on the west by <i>Western
Toumet</i>, on the north by the <i>Souniot</i>, on the south by
the Great Wall.&nbsp; Its extent is 150 leagues long, by 100
broad.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the <i>Tchakar</i> are all paid
soldiers of the Emperor.&nbsp; The foot soldiers receive twelve
ounces of silver per annum, and the cavalry twenty-four.</p>
<p>The <i>Tchakar</i> is divided into eight banners&mdash;in
Chinese <i>Pa-Ki</i>&mdash;distinguished by the name of eight
colours: white, blue, red, yellow, French white, light blue,
pink, and light yellow.&nbsp; Each banner has its separate
territory, and a tribunal, named <i>Nourou-Tchayn</i>, having
jurisdiction over all the matters that may occur in the
Banner.&nbsp; Besides this tribunal, there is, in each of the
Eight Banners, a chief called <i>Ou-Gourdha</i>.&nbsp; Of the
eight <i>Ou-Gourdhas</i> one is selected to fill at the same
time, the post of governor-general of the Eight Banners.&nbsp;
All these dignitaries are nominated and paid by the Emperor of
China.&nbsp; In fact, the Tchakar is nothing more nor less than a
vast camp, occupied by an army of reserve.&nbsp; In order, no
doubt, that this army may be at all times ready to march at the
first signal, the Tartars are severely prohibited to cultivate
the land.&nbsp; They must live upon their pay, and upon the
produce of their flocks and herds.&nbsp; The entire soil of the
Eight Banners is inalienable.&nbsp; It sometimes happens that an
individual sells his portion to some Chinese; but the sale is
always declared null and void if it comes in any shape before the
tribunals.</p>
<p>It is in these pasturages of the Tchakar that are found the
numerous and magnificent herds and flocks of the Emperor,
consisting of camels, horses, cattle, and sheep.&nbsp; There are
360 herds of horses alone, each numbering 1200 horses.&nbsp; It
is easy from this one detail, to imagine the enormous extent of
animals possessed here by the Emperor.&nbsp; A Tartar, decorated
with the white button, has charge of each herd.&nbsp; At certain
intervals, inspectors-general visit the herds, and if any
deficiency in the number is discovered, the chief herdsman has to
make it good at his own cost.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this
impending penalty, the Tartars do not fail to convert to their
own use the wealth of the Sacred Master, by means of a fraudulent
exchange.&nbsp; Whenever a Chinese has a broken-winded horse, or
a lame ox, he takes it to the imperial herdsman, who, for a
trifling consideration, allows him to select what animal he
pleases in exchange, from among the imperial herds.&nbsp; Being
thus always provided with the actual number of animals, they can
benefit by their fraud in perfect security.</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>Never in more splendid weather had we traversed a more
splendid country.&nbsp; The desert is at times horrible, hideous;
but it has also its charms&mdash;charms all the more intensely
appreciated, because they are rare in themselves, and because
they would in vain be sought in populated countries.&nbsp;
Tartary has an aspect altogether peculiar to itself: there is
nothing in the world that at all resembles a Tartar
landscape.&nbsp; In civilised countries you find, at every step,
populous towns, a rich and varied cultivation, the thousand and
one productions of arts and industry, the incessant movements of
commerce.&nbsp; You are constantly impelled onwards, carried
away, as it were, by some vast whirlwind.&nbsp; On the other
hand, in countries where civilisation has not as yet made its way
into the light, you ordinarily find nothing but primeval forests
in all the pomp of their exuberant and gigantic vegetation.&nbsp;
The soul seems crushed beneath a nature all powerful and
majestic.&nbsp; There is nothing of the kind in Tartary.&nbsp;
There are no towns, no edifices, no arts, no industry, no
cultivation, no forests; everywhere it is prairie, sometimes
interrupted by immense lakes, by majestic rivers, by rugged and
imposing mountains; sometimes spreading out into vast limitless
plains.&nbsp; There, in these verdant solitudes, the bounds of
which seem lost in the remote horizon, you might imagine yourself
gently rocking on the calm waves of some broad ocean.&nbsp; The
aspect of the prairies of Mongolia excites neither joy nor
sorrow, but rather a mixture of the two, a sentiment of gentle,
religious melancholy, which gradually elevates the soul, without
wholly excluding from its contemplation the things of this world;
a sentiment which belongs rather to Heaven than to earth, and
which seems in admirable conformity with the nature of intellect
served by organs.</p>
<p>You sometimes in Tartary come upon plains more animated than
those you have just traversed; they are those, whither the
greater supply of water and the choicest pastures have attracted
for a time a number of nomadic families.&nbsp; There you see
rising in all directions tents of various dimensions, looking
like balloons newly inflated, and just about to take their flight
into the air.&nbsp; Children, with a sort of hod at their backs,
run about collecting argols, which they pile up in heaps around
their respective tents.&nbsp; The matrons look after the calves,
make tea in the open air, or prepare milk in various ways; the
men, mounted on fiery horses, and armed with a long pole, gallop
about, guiding to the best pastures the great herds of cattle
which undulate, in the distance all around, like waves of the
sea.</p>
<p>All of a sudden these pictures, so full of animation,
disappear, and you see nothing of that which of late was so full
of life.&nbsp; Men, tents, herds, all have vanished in the
twinkling of an eye.&nbsp; You <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>merely see in
the desert heaps of embers, half-extinguished fires, and a few
bones, of which birds of prey are disputing the possession.&nbsp;
Such are the sole vestiges which announce that a Mongol tribe has
just passed that way.&nbsp; If you ask the reason of these abrupt
migrations, it is simply this:&mdash;the animals having devoured
all the grass that grew in the vicinity, the chief had given the
signal for departure; and all the shepherds, folding their tents,
had driven their herds before them, and proceeded, no matter
whither, in search of fresh fields and pastures new.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>After having journeyed the entire day through the delicious
prairies of the Red Banner, we halted to encamp for the night in
a valley that seemed full of people.&nbsp; We had scarcely
alighted, when a number of Tartars approached, and offered their
services.&nbsp; After having assisted us to unload our camels,
and set up our house of blue linen, they invited us to come and
take tea in their tents.&nbsp; As it was late, however, we stayed
at home, promising to pay them a visit next morning; for the
hospitable invitation of our new neighbours determined us to
remain for a day amongst them.&nbsp; We were, moreover, very well
pleased to profit by the beauty of the weather, and of the
locality, to recover from the fatigues we had undergone the day
before.</p>
<p>Next morning, the time not appropriated to our little
household cares, and the recitation of our Breviary, was devoted
to visiting the Mongol tents, Samdadchiemba being left at home in
charge of the tent.</p>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>We had to take especial care to the safety of our legs,
menaced by a whole host of watchdogs.&nbsp; A small stick
sufficed for the purpose; but Tartar etiquette required us to
leave these weapons at the threshold of our host&rsquo;s
abode.&nbsp; To enter a man&rsquo;s tent with a whip or a stick
in your hand is as great an insult as you can offer to the
family; and quite tantamount to saying, &ldquo;You are all
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visiting amongst the Tartars is a frank, simple affair,
altogether exempt from the endless formalities of Chinese
gentility.&nbsp; On entering, you give the word of peace
<i>amor</i> or <i>mendou</i>, to the company generally.&nbsp; You
then seat yourself on the right of the head of the family, whom
you find squatting on the floor, opposite the entrance.&nbsp;
Next, everybody takes from a purse suspended at his girdle a
little snuff-bottle, and mutual pinches accompany such phrases as
these: &ldquo;Is the pasturage with you rich and
abundant?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are your herds in fine
condition?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are your mares
productive?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you travel in
peace?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Does tranquillity prevail?&rdquo; and
so on.&nbsp; These questions and their answers being interchanged
always with intense gravity on both sides, the mistress of the
tent, without saying a word, holds out her hand to the
visitor.&nbsp; He as silently takes from his breast-pocket the
small wooden bowl, the indispensable vade-mecum of all Tartars,
and presents it to his hostess, who fills it with tea and milk,
and returns it.&nbsp; In the richer, more easily circumstanced
families, visitors have a small table placed before them, on
which is butter, oatmeal, grated millet, and bits of cheese,
separately contained in little boxes of polished wood.&nbsp;
These Tartar delicacies the visitors take mixed with their
tea.&nbsp; Such as propose to treat their guests in a style of
perfect magnificence make them partakers of a bottle of Mongol
wine, warmed in the ashes.&nbsp; This wine is nothing more than
skimmed milk, subjected for awhile to vinous fermentation, and
distilled through a rude apparatus that does the office of an
alembic.&nbsp; One must be a thorough Tartar to relish or even
endure this beverage, the flavour and odour of which are alike
insipid.</p>
<p>The Mongol tent, for about three feet from the ground, is
cylindrical in form.&nbsp; It then becomes conical, like a
pointed hat.&nbsp; The woodwork of the tent is composed below of
a trellis-work of crossed bars, which fold up and expand at
pleasure.&nbsp; Above these, a circle of poles, fixed in the
trellis-work, meets at the top, like the sticks of an
umbrella.&nbsp; Over the woodwork is stretched, once or twice, a
thick covering of coarse linen, and thus the tent is
composed.&nbsp; The door, which is always a folding door, is low
and narrow.&nbsp; A beam crosses it at the bottom by way of
threshold, so that on entering you have at once to raise your
feet and lower your head.&nbsp; Besides the door there is another
opening at the top of the tent to let out <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the
smoke.&nbsp; This opening can at any time be closed with a piece
of felt fastened above it in the tent, and which can be pulled
over it by means of a string, the end of which hangs by the
door.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p50.jpg">
<img alt=
"Interior of a Tartar Tent"

</a></p>
<p>The interior is divided into two compartments; that on the
left, as you enter, is reserved for the men, and thither the
visitors proceed.&nbsp; Any man who should enter on the right
side would be considered excessively rude.&nbsp; The right
compartment is occupied by the women, and there you find the
culinary utensils: large earthen vessels of glazed earth, wherein
to keep the store of water; trunks of trees, of different sizes,
hollowed into the shape of pails, and destined to contain the
preparations of milk, in the various forms which they make it
undergo.&nbsp; In the centre of the tent is a large trivet,
planted in the earth, and always ready to receive the large iron
bell-shaped cauldron that stands by, ready for use.</p>
<p>Behind the hearth, and facing the door, is a kind of sofa, the
most singular piece of furniture that we met with among the
Tartars.&nbsp; At the two ends are two pillows, having at their
extremity plates of copper, gilt, and skilfully engraved.&nbsp;
There is probably not a single tent where you do not find this
little couch, which seems to be an essential article of
furniture; but, strange to say, <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>during our
long journey we never saw one of them which seemed to have been
recently made.&nbsp; We had occasion to visit Mongol families,
where everything bore the mark of easy circumstances, even of
affluence, but everywhere alike this singular couch was shabby,
and of ancient fabric.&nbsp; But yet it seems made to last for
ever, and is regularly transmitted from generation to
generation.</p>
<p>In the towns where Tartar commerce is carried on, you may hunt
through every furniture shop, every brokers, every
pawnbroker&rsquo;s, but you meet with not one of these pieces of
furniture, new or old.</p>
<p>At the side of the couch, towards the men&rsquo;s quarter,
there is ordinarily a small square press, which contains the
various odds and ends that serve to set off the costume of this
simple people.&nbsp; This chest serves likewise as an altar for a
small image of Buddha.&nbsp; The divinity, in wood or copper, is
usually in a sitting posture, the legs crossed, and enveloped up
to the neck in a scarf of old yellow silk.&nbsp; Nine copper
vases, of the size and form of our liqueur glasses, are
symmetrically arranged before Buddha.&nbsp; It is in these small
chalices that the Tartars daily make to their idol offerings of
water, milk, butter, and meal.&nbsp; A few Thibetian books,
wrapped in yellow silk, perfect the decoration of the little
pagoda.&nbsp; Those whose heads are shaved, and who observe
celibacy, have alone the privilege of touching these
prayer-books.&nbsp; A layman, who should venture to take them
into his impure and profane hands, would commit a sacrilege.</p>
<p>A number of goats&rsquo; horns, fixed in the woodwork of the
tent, complete the furniture of the Mongol habitation.&nbsp; On
these hang the joints of beef or mutton destined for the
family&rsquo;s use, vessels filled with butter, bows, arrows, and
matchlocks; for there is scarcely a Tartar family which does not
possess at least one firearm.&nbsp; We were, therefore, surprised
to find M. Timkouski, in his Journey to Peking, <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> making this strange statement:
&ldquo;The sound of our fire-arms attracted the attention of the
Mongols, who are acquainted only with bows and
arrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Russian writer should have known that
fire-arms are not so foreign to the Tartars as he imagined; since
it is proved that already, as early as the commencement of the
13th century, <i>Tcheng-Kis-Khan</i> had artillery in his
armies.</p>
<p>The odour pervading the interior of the Mongol tents, is, to
those not accustomed to it, disgusting and almost
insupportable.&nbsp; This smell, so potent sometimes that it
seems to make one&rsquo;s heart rise to one&rsquo;s throat, is
occasioned by the mutton grease and butter with which everything
on or about a Tartar is impregnated.&nbsp; It is <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>on
account of this habitual filth, that they are called
<i>Tsao-Ta-Dze</i>, (Stinking Tartars), by the Chinese,
themselves not altogether inodorous, or by any means particular
about cleanliness.</p>
<p>Among the Tartars, household and family cares rest entirely
upon the woman; it is she who milks the cows, and prepares the
butter, cheese, etc.; who goes, no matter how far, to draw water;
who collects the argol fuel, dries it, and piles it around the
tent.&nbsp; The making of clothes, the tanning of skins, the
fulling of cloth, all appertains to her; the sole assistance she
obtains, in these various labours, being that of her sons, and
then only while they are quite young.</p>
<p>The occupations of the men are of very limited range; they
consist wholly in conducting the flocks and herds to
pasture.&nbsp; This for men accustomed from their infancy to
horseback is rather an amusement than a labour.&nbsp; In point of
fact, the nearest approach to fatigue they ever incur, is when
some of their cattle escape; they then dash off at full gallop,
in pursuit, up hill and down dale, until they have found the
missing animals, and brought them back to the herd.&nbsp; The
Tartars sometimes hunt; but it is rather with a view to what they
can catch than from any amusement they derive from the exercise;
the only occasions on which they go out with their bows and
matchlocks are when they desire to shoot roebucks, deer, or
pheasants, as presents for their chiefs.&nbsp; Foxes they always
course.&nbsp; To shoot them, or take them in traps, would, they
consider, injure the skin, which is held in high estimation among
them.&nbsp; They ridicule the Chinese immensely on account of
their trapping these animals at night.&nbsp; &ldquo;We,&rdquo;
said a famous hunter of the Red Banner to us, &ldquo;set about
the thing in an honest straightforward way.&nbsp; When we see a
fox, we jump on horseback, and gallop after him till we have run
him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the exception of their equestrian exercises, the Mongol
Tartars pass their time in an absolute <i>far niente</i>,
sleeping all night, and squatting all day in their tents, dosing,
drinking tea, or smoking.&nbsp; At intervals, however, the Tartar
conceives a fancy to take a lounge abroad; and his lounge is
somewhat different from that of the Parisian idler; he needs
neither cane nor quizzing glass; but when the fancy occurs, he
takes down his whip from its place above the door, mounts his
horse, always ready saddled outside the door, and dashes off into
the desert, no matter whither.&nbsp; When he sees another
horseman in the distance, he rides up to him; when he sees the
smoke of a tent, he rides up to that; the only object in either
case being to have a chat with some new person.</p>
<p>The two days we passed in these fine plains of the
<i>Tchakar</i>, were not without good use.&nbsp; We were able at
leisure to dry and <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>repair our clothes and our baggage;
but, above all, it gave us an opportunity to study the Tartars
close at hand, and to initiate ourselves in the habits of the
nomad peoples.&nbsp; As we were making preparations for
departure, these temporary neighbours aided us to fold our tent
and to load our camels.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said
they, &ldquo;you had better encamp to-night at the Three Lakes;
the pasturage there is good and abundant.&nbsp; If you make haste
you will reach the place before sunset.&nbsp; On this side, and
on the other side of the Three Lakes, there is no water for a
considerable distance.&nbsp; Sirs Lamas, a good journey to
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace be with you, and fare well!&rdquo;
responded we, and with that proceeded once more on our way,
Samdadchiemba heading the caravan, mounted on his little black
mule.&nbsp; We quitted this encampment without regret, just as we
had quitted preceding encampments; except indeed, that here we
left, on the spot where our tent had stood, a greater heap of
ashes, and that the grass around it was more trodden than was
usual with us.</p>
<p>During the morning the weather was magnificent, though
somewhat cold.&nbsp; But in the afternoon the north wind rose,
and began to blow with extreme violence.&nbsp; It soon became so
cutting, that we regretted we had not with us our great fur caps,
to operate as a protector for the face.&nbsp; We hurried on, in
order the sooner to reach the Three Lakes, and to have the
shelter there of our dear tent.&nbsp; In the hope of discovering
these lakes, that had been promised us by our late friends, we
were constantly looking right and left, but in vain.&nbsp; It
grew late, and, according to the information of the Tartars, we
began to fear we must have passed the only encampment we were
likely to find that day.&nbsp; By dint of straining our eyes, we
at length got sight of a horseman, slowly riding along the bottom
of a lateral valley.&nbsp; He was at some distance from us; but
it was essential that we should obtain information from
him.&nbsp; M. Gabet accordingly hastened after him, at the utmost
speed of his tall camel&rsquo;s long legs.&nbsp; The horseman
heard the cries of the camel, looked back, and seeing that some
one was approaching him, turned his horse round, and galloped
towards M. Gabet.&nbsp; As soon as he got within ear-shot:
&ldquo;Holy personage,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;has your eye
perceived the yellow goats?&nbsp; I have lost all traces of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not seen the yellow goats; I
seek water, and cannot find it.&nbsp; Is it far
hence?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence came you?&nbsp; Whither go
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I belong to the little caravan you see
yonder.&nbsp; We have been told that we should this evening on
our way, find lakes, upon the banks of which we could
commodiously encamp; but hitherto we have seen nothing of the
kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How could that be?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but
a few minutes ago you passed within a few yards of the
water.&nbsp; Sir Lama, permit me to attend your shadow; I will
guide you to the <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Three Lakes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so
saying, he gave his horse three swinging lashes with his whip, in
order to put it into a pace commensurate with that of the
camel.&nbsp; In a minute he had joined us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Men of
prayer,&rdquo; said the hunter, &ldquo;you have come somewhat too
far; you must turn back.&nbsp; Look&rdquo; (pointing with his
bow) &ldquo;yonder; you see those storks hovering over some
reeds: there you will find the Three Lakes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thanks, brother,&rdquo; said we; &ldquo;we regret that we
cannot show you your yellow goats as clearly as you have shown us
the Three Lakes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mongol hunter saluted us, with
his clasped hands raised to his forehead, and we proceeded with
entire confidence towards the spot he had pointed out.&nbsp; We
had advanced but a few paces before we found indications of the
near presence of some peculiar waters.&nbsp; The grass was less
continuous and less green, and cracked under our animals&rsquo;
hoofs like dried leaves; the white efflorescence of saltpetre
manifested itself more and more thickly.&nbsp; At last we found
ourselves on the bank of one lake, near which were two
others.&nbsp; We immediately alighted, and set about erecting our
tent; but the wind was so violent that it was only after long
labour and much patience that we completed the task.</p>
<p>While Samdadchiemba was boiling our tea, we amused ourselves
with watching the camels as they luxuriously licked up the
saltpetre with which the ground was powdered.&nbsp; Next they
bent over the edge of the lake, and inhaled long, insatiable
draughts of the brackish water, which we could see ascending
their long necks as up some flexible pump.</p>
<p>We had been for some time occupied in this not unpicturesque
recreation, when, all of a sudden, we heard behind us a confused,
tumultuous noise, resembling the vehement flapping of sails,
beaten about by contrary and violent winds.&nbsp; Soon we
distinguished, amid the uproar, loud cries proceeding from
Samdadchiemba.&nbsp; We hastened towards him, and were just in
time to prevent, by our co-operation, the typhoon from uprooting
and carrying off our linen <i>louvre</i>.&nbsp; Since our
arrival, the wind, augmenting in violence, had also changed its
direction; so that it now blew exactly from the quarter facing
which we had placed the opening of our tent.&nbsp; We had
especial occasion to fear that the tent would be set on fire by
the lighted argols that were driven about by the wind.&nbsp; Our
first business therefore was to tack about; and after a while we
succeeded in making our tent secure, and so got off with our fear
and a little fatigue.&nbsp; The misadventure, however, put
Samdadchiemba into a desperately bad humour throughout the
evening; for the wind, by extinguishing the fire, delayed the
preparation of his darling tea.</p>
<p>The wind fell as the night advanced, and by degrees the <!--
page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>weather became magnificent; the sky was clear, the moon
full and bright, and the stars glittered like diamonds.&nbsp;
Alone, in this vast solitude, we distinguished in the distance
only the fantastic and indistinct outline of the mountains which
loomed in the horizon like gigantic phantoms, while the only
sound we heard was the cries of the thousand aquatic birds, as,
on the surface of the lakes, they contended for the ends of the
reeds and the broad leaves of the water-lily.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba
was by no means a person to appreciate the charms of this
tranquil scene.&nbsp; He had succeeded in again lighting the
fire, and was absorbed in the preparation of his tea.&nbsp; We
accordingly left him squatted before the kettle, and went to
recite the service, walking round the larger lake, which was
nearly half a league in circuit.&nbsp; We had proceeded about
half round it, praying alternately, when insensibly our voices
fell, and our steps were stayed.&nbsp; We both stopped
spontaneously, and listened intently, without venturing to
interchange a word, and even endeavouring to suppress our
respiration.&nbsp; At last we expressed to each other the cause
of our mutual terror, but it was in tones low and full of
emotion: &ldquo;Did you not hear, just now, and quite close to
us, what seemed the voices of men?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, a
number of voices, speaking as though in secret
consultation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet we are alone
here:&mdash;&rsquo;tis very surprising.&nbsp; Hist! let us listen
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I hear nothing; doubtless we were
under some illusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; We resumed our walk, and the
recitation of our prayers.&nbsp; But we had not advanced ten
steps, before we again stopped; for we heard, and very
distinctly, the noise which had before alarmed us, and which
seemed the confused vague murmur of several voices discussing
some point in under tones.&nbsp; Yet nothing was visible.&nbsp;
We got upon a hillock, and thence, by the moon&rsquo;s light,
saw, at a short distance, some human forms moving in the long
grass.&nbsp; We could hear their voices too, but not distinctly
enough to know whether they spoke Chinese or Tartar.&nbsp; We
retraced our steps to our tent, as rapidly as was consistent with
the maintenance of silence; for we took these people to be
robbers, who, having perceived our tent, were deliberating as to
the best means of pillaging us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not in safety here,&rdquo; said we to
Samdadchiemba; &ldquo;we have discovered, quite close to us, a
number of men, and we have heard their voices.&nbsp; Go and
collect the animals, and bring them to the tent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Samdadchiemba, knitting his brows,
&ldquo;if the robbers come, what shall we do?&nbsp; May we fight
them?&nbsp; May we kill them?&nbsp; Will Holy Church permit
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;First go and collect the animals;
afterwards we will tell you what we must do.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
animals being brought together, and fastened outside the tent, we
directed our intrepid Samdadchiemba to finish <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>his tea, and
we returned on tip-toe to the spot where we had seen and heard
our mysterious visitors.&nbsp; We looked around in every
direction, with eye and ear intent; but we could neither see nor
hear any one.&nbsp; A well-trodden pathway, however, which we
discovered among the reeds of tall grass on the margin of the
greater lake, indicated to us that those whom we had taken to be
robbers were inoffensive passengers, whose route lay in that
direction.&nbsp; We returned joyfully to our tent, where we found
our valorous Samdadchiemba actively employed in sharpening, upon
the top of his leather boots, a great Russian cutlass, which he
had purchased at <i>Tolon-Noor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
exclaimed he, fiercely, trying with his thumb the edge of his
sword, &ldquo;where are the robbers?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are no robbers; unroll the goat-skins, that we may go to
sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity there are no
robbers; for here is something that would have cut into them
famously!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, ay, Samdadchiemba, you are
wonderfully brave now, because you know there are no
robbers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my spiritual fathers, it is not
so; one should always speak the words of candour.&nbsp; I admit
that my memory is very bad, and that I have never been able to
learn many prayers; but as to courage, I may boast of having as
much of it as another.&rdquo;&nbsp; We laughed at this singularly
expressed sally.&nbsp; &ldquo;You laugh, my spiritual
fathers,&rdquo; said Samdadchiemba.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you do not
know the Dchiahours.&nbsp; In the west, the land of
<i>San-Tchouan</i> (Three Valleys) enjoys much renown.&nbsp; My
countrymen hold life in little value; they have always a sabre by
their side, and a long matchlock on their shoulder.&nbsp; For a
word, for a look, they fight and kill one another.&nbsp; A
Dchiahour, who has never killed any one, is considered to have no
right to hold his head up among his countrymen.&nbsp; He cannot
pretend to the character of a brave man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
fine!&nbsp; Well, you are a brave man, you say: tell us how many
men did you kill when you were in the Three Valleys?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba seemed somewhat disconcerted by this question; he
looked away, and broke out into a forced laugh.&nbsp; At last, by
way of diverting the subject, he plunged his cup into the kettle,
and drew it out full of tea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;drink your tea, and then tell us about your
exploits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba wiped his cup with the skirt of his jacket, and
having replaced it in his bosom, addressed us gravely, thus:
&ldquo;My spiritual fathers, since you desire I should speak to
you about myself, I will do so; it was a great sin I committed,
but I think Jehovah pardoned me when I entered the holy
Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was quite a child, not more at the utmost, than seven
years old.&nbsp; I was in the fields about my father&rsquo;s
house, tending an old she-donkey, the only animal we
possessed.&nbsp; One of my companions, a boy about my own age,
came to play with me.&nbsp; We began <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>quarrelling,
and from words fell to blows.&nbsp; I struck him on the head with
a great root of a tree that I had in my hand, and the blow was so
heavy that he fell motionless at my feet.&nbsp; When I saw my
companion stretched on the earth, I stood for a moment as it were
paralysed, not knowing what to think or to do.&nbsp; Then an
awful fear came over me, that I should be seized and
killed.&nbsp; I looked all about me in search of a hole wherein I
might conceal my companion, but I saw nothing of the kind.&nbsp;
I then thought of hiding myself.&nbsp; At a short distance from
our house there was a great pile of brushwood, collected for
fuel.&nbsp; I directed my steps thither, and with great labour
made a hole, into which, after desperately scratching myself, I
managed to creep up to my neck, resolved never to come out of
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When night fell, I found they were seeking me.&nbsp; My
mother was calling me in all directions; but I took good care not
to answer.&nbsp; I was even anxious not to move the brushwood,
lest the sound should lead to my discovery, and, as I
anticipated, to my being killed.&nbsp; I was terribly frightened
when I heard a number of people crying out, and disputing, I
concluded, about me.&nbsp; The night passed away; in the morning
I felt devouringly hungry.&nbsp; I began to cry; but I could not
even cry at my ease, for I feared to be discovered by the people
whom I heard moving about, and I was resolved never to quit the
brushwood.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But were you not afraid you should
die of hunger?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The idea never occurred to me;
I felt hungry indeed, but that was all.&nbsp; The reason I had
for concealing myself was that I might not die; for I thought
that if they did not find me, of course they could not kill
me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, and how long did you remain in the
brushwood?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I have often heard people
say that you can&rsquo;t remain long without eating; but those
who say so, never tried the experiment.&nbsp; I can answer for
it, that a boy of seven years old can live, at all events, three
days and four nights, without eating anything whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the fourth night, early in the morning, they
found me in my hole.&nbsp; When I felt they were taking me out, I
struggled as well as I could, and endeavoured to get away.&nbsp;
My father took me by the arm.&nbsp; I cried and sobbed, &lsquo;Do
not kill me, do not kill me,&rsquo; cried I; &lsquo;it was not I
who killed <i>Nasamboyan</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; They carried me to the
house, for I would not walk.&nbsp; While I wept, in utter
despair, the people about me laughed.&nbsp; At last they told me
not to be afraid, for that Nasamboyan was not dead, and soon
afterwards Nasamboyan came into the room as well as ever, only
that he had a great bruise on his face.&nbsp; The blow I had
struck him had merely knocked him down, and stunned
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Dchiahour had finished this narrative, he looked at
us in turns, laughing and repeating, again and again, &ldquo;Who
will <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>say people cannot live without eating?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;this is a very good
beginning, Samdadchiemba; but you have not told us yet how many
men you have killed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never killed any one;
but that was merely because I did not stay long enough in my
native Three Valleys; for at the age of ten they put me into a
great Lamasery.&nbsp; I had for my especial master a very rough,
cross man, who gave me the strap every day, because I could not
repeat the prayers he taught me.&nbsp; But it was to no purpose
he beat me; I could learn nothing: so he left off teaching me,
and sent me out to fetch water and collect fuel.&nbsp; But he
continued to thrash me as hard as over, until the life I led
became quite insupportable, and at last I ran off with some
provisions, and made my way towards Tartary.&nbsp; After walking
several days, haphazard, and perfectly ignorant where I was, I
encountered the train of a Grand Lama who was repairing to
Peking.&nbsp; I joined the caravan, and was employed to take
charge of a flock of sheep that accompanied the party, and served
for its food.&nbsp; There was no room for me in any of the tents,
so I had to sleep in the open air.&nbsp; One evening I took up my
quarters behind a rock, which sheltered me from the wind.&nbsp;
In the morning, waking somewhat later than usual, I found the
encampment struck, and the people all gone.&nbsp; I was left
alone in the desert.&nbsp; At this time I knew nothing about
east, west, north, or south; I had consequently no resource but
to wander on at random, until I should find some Tartar
station.&nbsp; I lived in this way for three years&mdash;now
here, now there, exchanging such slight services as I could
render for my food and tent-room.&nbsp; At last I reached Peking,
and presented myself at the gate of the Great Lamasery of
<i>Hoang-Sse</i>, which is entirely composed of Dchiahour and
Thibetian Lamas.&nbsp; I was at once admitted, and my countrymen
having clubbed together to buy me a red scarf and a yellow cap, I
was enabled to join the chorus in the recitation of prayers, and,
of consequence, to claim my share in the distribution of
alms.&rdquo;&mdash;We interrupted Samdadchiemba at this point, in
order to learn from him how he could take part in the recitation
of prayers, without having learned either to read or
pray.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the thing was easy
enough.&nbsp; They gave me an old book; I held it on my knees,
and mumbling out some gibberish between my lips, endeavoured to
catch the tone of my neighbours.&nbsp; When they turned over a
leaf, I turned over a leaf; so that, altogether, there was no
reason why the leader of the chorus should take any notice of my
man&oelig;uvre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, however, a circumstance occurred that very
nearly occasioned my expulsion from the Lamasery.&nbsp; An
ill-natured Lama, who had remarked my method of reciting the
prayers, used to amuse himself with mocking me, and creating a
laugh at my expense.&nbsp; When the Emperor&rsquo;s mother died,
we were all invited to <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the <i>Yellow Palace</i> to recite
prayers.&nbsp; Before the ceremony commenced, I was sitting
quietly in my place, with my book on my knees, when this roguish
fellow came gently behind me, and looking over my shoulder
mumbled out something or other in imitation of my manner.&nbsp;
Losing all self-possession, I gave him so hard a blow upon the
face, that he fell on his back.&nbsp; The incident excited great
confusion in the <i>Yellow Palace</i>.&nbsp; The superiors were
informed of the matter, and by the severe rules of Thibetian
discipline, I was liable to be flogged for three days with the
black whip, and then, my hands and feet in irons, to be
imprisoned for a year in the tower of the Lamasery.&nbsp; One of
the principals, however, who had taken notice of me before,
interposed in my favour.&nbsp; He went to the Lamas who
constituted the council of discipline, and represented to them
the fact that the disciple who had been struck was a person
notorious for annoying his companions, and that I had received
extreme provocation from him.&nbsp; He spoke so warmly in my
favour that I was pardoned on the mere condition of making an
apology.&nbsp; I accordingly placed myself in the way of the Lama
whom I had offended: &lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;shall
we go and drink a cup of tea together?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied he; &lsquo;there is no reason
why I should not drink a cup of tea with you.&rsquo;&nbsp; We
went out, and entered the first tea-house that presented
itself.&nbsp; Seating ourselves at one of the tables in the
tea-room, I offered my snuff bottle to my companion, saying:
&lsquo;Elder brother, the other day we had a little disagreement;
that was not well.&nbsp; You must confess that you were not
altogether free from blame.&nbsp; I, on my part, admit that I
dealt too heavy a blow.&nbsp; But the matter has grown old; we
will think no more about it.&rsquo;&nbsp; We then drank our tea,
interchanged various civilities, and so the thing
ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and similar anecdotes of our Dchiahour had carried us
far into the night.&nbsp; The camels, indeed, were already up and
browsing their breakfast on the banks of the lake.&nbsp; We had
but brief time before us for repose.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my
part,&rdquo; said Samdadchiemba, &ldquo;I will not lie down at
all, but look after the camels.&nbsp; Day will soon break.&nbsp;
Meantime I&rsquo;ll make a good fire, and prepare the
<i>pan-tan</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before Samdadchiemba roused us with the
intimation that the sun was up, and the <i>pan-tan</i>
ready.&nbsp; We at once rose, and after eating a cup of
<i>pan-tan</i>, or, in other words, of oatmeal diluted with
boiling water, we planted our little cross upon a hillock, and
proceeded upon our pilgrimage.</p>
<p>It was past noon when we came to a place where three wells had
been dug, at short distances, the one from the other.&nbsp;
Although it was early in the day, we still thought we had better
encamp here.&nbsp; A vast plain, on which we could discern no
sort of habitation, stretched out before us to the distant
horizon; and we might fairly <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>conclude it
destitute of water, since the Tartars had taken the trouble to
dig these wells.&nbsp; We therefore set up our tent.&nbsp; We
soon found, however, that we had selected a detestable
encampment.&nbsp; With excessive nastiness of very brackish and
very fetid water was combined extreme scarcity of fuel.&nbsp; We
looked about for argols, but in vain.&nbsp; At last
Samdadchiemba, whose eyes were better than ours, discerned in the
distance a sort of enclosure, in which he concluded that cattle
had been folded.&nbsp; He took a camel with him to the place in
the hope of finding plenty of argols there, and he certainly
returned with an ample supply of the article; but unfortunately
the precious manure-fuel was not quite dry; it absolutely refused
to burn.&nbsp; The Dchiahour essayed an experiment.&nbsp; He
hollowed out a sort of furnace in the ground, surmounting it with
a turf chimney.&nbsp; The structure was extremely picturesque,
but it laboured under the enormous disadvantage of being wholly
useless.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba arranged and re-arranged his fuel,
and puffed, and puffed, with the full force of his potent
lungs.&nbsp; It was all lost labour.&nbsp; There was smoke
enough, and to spare; we were enveloped in smoke, but not a spark
of fire: and the water in the kettle remained relentlessly
passive.&nbsp; It was obvious that to boil our tea or heat
oatmeal was out of the question.&nbsp; Yet we were anxious, at
all events, to take the chill off the water, so as to disguise,
by the warmth, its brackish flavour and its disagreeable
smell.&nbsp; We adopted this expedient.</p>
<p>You meet in the plains of Mongolia with a sort of grey
squirrel, living in holes like rats.&nbsp; These animals
construct, over the opening of their little dens, a sort of
miniature dome, composed of grass, artistically twisted, and
designed as a shelter from wind and rain.&nbsp; These little
heaps of dry grass are of the form and size of molehills.&nbsp;
The place where we had now set up our tent abounded with these
grey squirrels.&nbsp; Thirst made us cruel, and we proceeded to
level the house-domes of these poor little animals, which
retreated into their holes below as we approached them.&nbsp; By
means of this vandalism we managed to collect a sackful of
efficient fuel, and so warmed the water of the well, which was
our only aliment during the day.</p>
<p>Our provisions had materially diminished, notwithstanding the
economy to which the want of fire on this and other occasions had
reduced us.&nbsp; There remained very little meal or millet in
our store bags, when we learned, from a Tartar whom we met on the
way, that we were at no great distance from a trading station
called <i>Chabort&eacute;</i> (Slough.)&nbsp; It lay, indeed,
somewhat out of the route we were pursuing; but there was no
other place at which we could supply ourselves with provisions,
until we came to Blue-Town, from which we were distant a hundred
leagues.&nbsp; We turned therefore obliquely to the left, and
soon reached Chabort&eacute;.</p>

<p>We arrived at Chabort&eacute; on the fifteenth day of the
eighth moon, the anniversary of great rejoicings among the
Chinese.&nbsp; This festival, known as the <i>Yu&eacute;-Ping</i>
(Loaves of the Moon), dates from the remotest antiquity.&nbsp;
Its original purpose was to honour the moon with superstitious
rites.&nbsp; On this solemn day, all labour is suspended; the
workmen receive from their employers a present of money; every
person puts on his best clothes; and there is merrymaking in
every family.&nbsp; Relations and friends interchange cakes of
various sizes, on which is stamped the image of the moon; that is
to say, a hare crouching amid a small group of trees.</p>
<p>Since the fourteenth century, this festival has borne a
political <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>character, little understood,
apparently, by the Mongols; but the tradition of which is
carefully preserved by the Chinese.&nbsp; About the year 1368,
the Chinese were desirous of shaking off the yoke of Tartar
dynasty, founded by Tcheng-Kis-Khan, and which had then swayed
the empire for nearly a hundred years.&nbsp; A vast conspiracy
was formed throughout all the provinces, which was simultaneously
to develop itself, on the 15th day of the eighth moon, by the
massacre of the Mongol soldiers, who were billeted upon each
Chinese family, for the double purpose of maintaining themselves
and their conquest.&nbsp; The signal was given by a letter
concealed in the cakes which, as we have stated, are on that day,
mutually interchanged throughout the country.&nbsp; The massacre
was effected, and the Tartar army dispersed in the houses of the
Chinese, utterly annihilated.&nbsp; This catastrophe put an end
to the Mongol domination; and ever since, the Chinese, in
celebrating the festival of <i>Yu&eacute;-Ping</i>, have been
less intent upon the superstitious worship of the moon, than upon
the tragic event to which they owed the recovery of their
national independence.</p>
<p>The Mongols seem to have entirely lost all memory of the
sanguinary revolution; for every year they take their full part
in the festival of the Loaves of the Moon, and thus celebrate,
without apparently knowing it, the triumph which their enemies
heretofore gained over their ancestors.</p>
<p>At a gun-shot from the place where we were encamped, we
perceived several Mongol tents, the size and character of which
indicated easiness of circumstances in the proprietors.&nbsp;
This indication was confirmed by the large herds of cattle,
sheep, and horses, which were pasturing around.&nbsp; While we
were reciting the Breviary in our tent, Samdadchiemba went to pay
a visit to these Mongols.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, we saw
approaching an old man with a long white beard, and whose
features bespoke him a personage of distinction.&nbsp; He was
accompanied by a young Lama, and by a little boy who held his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;all men are brothers; but they who dwell in tents are
united one with another as flesh with bone.&nbsp; Sirs Lamas,
will you come and seat yourselves, for a while, in my poor
abode?&nbsp; The fifteenth of this moon is a solemn epoch; you
are strangers and travellers, and therefore cannot this evening
occupy your places at the hearth of your own noble family.&nbsp;
Come and repose for a few days with us; your presence will bring
us peace and happiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; We told the good old man
that we could not wholly accept his offer, but that, in the
evening, after prayers, we would come and take tea with him, and
converse for a while about the Mongol nation.&nbsp; The venerable
Tartar hereupon took his leave; but he had not been gone long,
before the young Lama who had <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>accompanied
him returned, and told us that his people were awaiting our
presence.&nbsp; We felt that we could not refuse at once to
comply with an invitation so full of frank cordiality, and
accordingly, having directed our Dchiahour to take good care of
the tent, we followed the young Lama who had come in quest of
us.</p>
<p>Upon entering the Mongol tent, we were struck and astonished
at finding a cleanliness one is little accustomed to see in
Tartary.&nbsp; There was not the ordinary coarse fire-place in
the centre, and the eye was not offended with the rude dirty
kitchen utensils which generally encumber Tartar
habitations.&nbsp; It was obvious, besides, that every thing had
been prepared for a festival.&nbsp; We seated ourselves upon a
large red carpet; and there was almost immediately brought to us,
from the adjacent tent, which served as a kitchen, some tea with
milk, some small loaves fried in butter; cheese, raisins, and
jujubs.</p>
<p>After having been introduced to the numerous Mongols by whom
we found ourselves surrounded, the conversation insensibly turned
upon the festival of the Loaves of the Moon.&nbsp; &ldquo;In our
Western Land,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;this festival is unknown;
men there adore only Jehovah, the Creator of the heavens, and of
the earth, of the sun, of the moon, and of all that
exists.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, what a holy doctrine!&rdquo;
exclaimed the old man, raising his clasped hands to his forehead;
&ldquo;the Tartars themselves, for that matter, do not worship
the moon; but seeing that the Chinese celebrate this festival,
they follow the custom without very well knowing
why.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You say truly; you do not, indeed, know
why you celebrate this festival.&nbsp; That is what we heard in
the land of the <i>Kitat</i> (Chinese).&nbsp; But do you know why
the Kitat celebrate it?&rdquo; and thereupon we related to these
Mongols what we knew of the terrible massacre of their
ancestors.&nbsp; Upon the completion of our narrative, we saw the
faces of all our audience full of astonishment.&nbsp; The young
men whispered to one another; the old man preserved a mournful
silence; his head bent down, and big tears flowing from his
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother rich in years,&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;this story does not seem to surprise you as it does your
young men, but it fills your heart with emotion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Holy personages,&rdquo; replied the elder, raising his
head, and wiping away the tears with the back of his hand,
&ldquo;the terrible event which occasions such consternation in
the minds of my young men was not unknown to me, but I would I
had never heard of it, and I always struggle against its
recollection, for it brings the hot blood into the forehead of
every Tartar, whose heart is not sold to the Kitat.&nbsp; A day
known to our great Lamas will come, when the blood of our
fathers, so shamefully assassinated, will at length be
avenged.&nbsp; When the holy man who is to lead us to vengeance
shall appear, <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>every one of us will rise and follow
in his train; then we shall march, in the face of day, and
require from the Kitat an account of the Tartar blood which they
shed in the silence and dark secrecy of their houses.&nbsp; The
Mongols celebrate every year this festival, most of them seeing
in it merely an indifferent ceremony; but the Loaves of the
Moon-day ever recalls, in the hearts of a few amongst us, the
memory of the treachery to which our fathers fell victims, and
the hope of just vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief silence, the old man went on: &ldquo;Holy
personages, whatever may be the associations of this day, in
other respects it is truly a festival for us, since you have
deigned to enter our poor habitation.&nbsp; Let us not further
occupy our breasts with sad thoughts.&nbsp; Child,&rdquo; said he
to a young man seated on the threshold of the tent, &ldquo;if the
mutton is boiled enough, clear away these things.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This command having been executed, the eldest son of the family
entered, bearing in both hands a small oblong table, on which was
a boiled sheep, cut into four quarters, heaped one on the
other.&nbsp; The family being assembled round the table, the
chief drew a knife from his girdle, severed the sheep&rsquo;s
tail, and divided it into two equal pieces, which he placed
before us.</p>
<p>With the Tartars, the tail is considered the most delicious
portion of their sheep, and accordingly the most
honourable.&nbsp; These tails of the Tartarian sheep are of
immense size and weight, the fat upon them alone weighing from
six to eight pounds.</p>
<p>The fat and juicy tail having thus been offered a homage to
the two stranger guests, the rest of the company, knife in hand,
attacked the four quarters of the animal, and had speedily, each
man, a huge piece before him.&nbsp; Plate or fork there was none,
the knees supplied the absence of the one, the hands of the
other, the flowing grease being wiped off, from time to time,
upon the front of the jacket.&nbsp; Our own embarrassment was
extreme.&nbsp; That great white mass of fat had been given to us
with the best intentions, but, not quite clear of European
prejudices, we could not make up our stomachs to venture, without
bread or salt, upon the lumps of tallow that quivered in our
hands.&nbsp; We briefly consulted, in our native tongue, as to
what on earth was to be done under these distressing
circumstances.&nbsp; Furtively, to replace the horrible masses
upon the table would be imprudent; openly to express to our
Amphytrion our repugnance to this <i>par excellence</i> Tartarian
delicacy, was impossible, as wholly opposed to Tartar
etiquette.&nbsp; We devised this plan: we cut the villainous tail
into numerous pieces, and insisted, in that day of general
rejoicing, upon the company&rsquo;s partaking with us of this
precious dish.&nbsp; There was infinite reluctance to deprive us
of the treat; but we persisted, and by degrees got entirely <!--
page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>clear of the abominable mess, ourselves rejoicing,
instead, in a cut from the leg, the savour of which was more
agreeable to our early training.&nbsp; The Homeric repast
completed, a heap of polished bones alone remaining to recall it,
a boy, taking from the goat&rsquo;s-horn on which it hung a rude
three-stringed violin, presented it to the chief, who, in his
turn, handed it to a young man of modest mien, whose eyes lighted
up as he received the instrument.&nbsp; &ldquo;Noble and holy
travellers,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;I have invited a
Toolholos to embellish this entertainment with some
recitations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The minstrel was already preluding with
his fingers upon the strings of his instrument.&nbsp; Presently
he began to sing, in a strong, emphatic voice, at times
interweaving with his verses recitations full of fire and
animation.&nbsp; It was interesting to see all those Tartar faces
bent towards the Minstrel, and accompanying the meaning of his
words with the movements of their features.&nbsp; The
<i>Toolholos</i> selected, for his subjects, national traditions,
which warmly excited the feelings of his audience.&nbsp; As to
ourselves, very slightly acquainted with the history of Tartary,
we took small interest in all those illustrious unknown, whom the
Mongol rhapsodist marshalled over the scene.</p>
<p>When he had sung for some time, the old man presented to him a
large cup of milk-wine.&nbsp; The minstrel placed his instrument
upon his knees, and with evident relish proceeded to moisten his
throat, parched with the infinitude of marvels he had been
relating.&nbsp; While, having finished his draught, he was
licking the brim of his cup: &ldquo;<i>Toolholos</i>,&rdquo; said
we, &ldquo;the songs you have sung were all excellent.&nbsp; But
you have as yet said nothing about the Immortal Tamerlane: the
&lsquo;Invocation to Timour,&rsquo; we have heard, is a famous
song, dear to the Mongols.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo;
exclaimed several voices at once, &ldquo;sing us the
&lsquo;Invocation to Timour.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a
moment&rsquo;s silence, and then the Toolholos, having refreshed
his memory, sang, in a vigorous and warlike tone, the following
strophes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the divine Timour dwelt within our
tents, the Mongol nation was redoubtable and warlike; its least
movements made the earth bend; its mere look froze with fear the
ten thousand peoples upon whom the sun shines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O divine Timour, will thy great soul soon revive?<br />
Return! return! we await thee, O Timour!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live in our vast plains, tranquil and peaceful as
sheep; yet our hearts are fervent and full of life.&nbsp; The
memory of the glorious age of Timour is ever present to our
minds.&nbsp; Where is the chief who is to place himself at our
head, and render us once more great warriors?</p>
<p>&ldquo;O divine Timour, will thy great soul soon revive?<br />
Return! return! we await thee, O Timour!</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;The young Mongol has arms wherewith to quell the
wild horse, eyes wherewith he sees afar off in the desert the
traces of the lost camel.&nbsp; Alas! his arms can no longer bend
the bow of his ancestors; his eye cannot see the wiles of the
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O divine Timour, will thy great soul soon revive?<br />
Return! return! we await thee, O Timour!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have burned the sweet smelling wood at the feet of
the divine Timour, our foreheads bent to the earth; we have
offered to him the green leaf of tea and the milk of our
herds.&nbsp; We are ready; the Mongols are on foot, O
Timour!&nbsp; And do thou, O Lama, send down good fortune upon
our arrows and our lances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O divine Timour, will thy great soul soon revive?<br />
Return! return! we await thee, O Timour!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Tartar Troubadour had completed this national song,
he rose, made a low bow to the company, and, having suspended his
instrument upon a wooden pin, took his leave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our
neighbours,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;are also keeping the
festival, and expect the Toolholos: but, since you seem to listen
with interest to Tartar songs, we will offer some other melodies
to your notice.&nbsp; We have in our own family a brother who has
in his memory a great number of airs, cherished by the Mongols;
but he cannot play; he is not a Toolholos.&nbsp; Come, brother
Nymbo, sing; you have not got Lamas of the West to listen to you
every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Mongol, whom, seated as he was in a corner, we had not
before noticed, at once rose, and took the place of the departed
<i>Toolholos</i>.&nbsp; The appearance of this personage was
truly remarkable; his neck was completely buried in his enormous
shoulders; his great dull staring eyes contrasted strangely with
his dark face, half-calcined as it were by the sun; his hair, or
rather a coarse uncombed mane, straggling down his back,
completed the savageness of his aspect.&nbsp; He began to sing:
but his singing was a mere counterfeit, an absurd parody.&nbsp;
His grand quality was extreme long-windedness, which enabled him
to execute roulades, complicated and continuous enough to throw
any rational audience into fits.&nbsp; We soon became desperately
tired of his noise, and watched with impatience a moment&rsquo;s
cessation, that might give us an opportunity of retiring.&nbsp;
But this was no easy matter; the villain divined our thoughts,
and was resolved to spite us.&nbsp; No sooner had he finished one
air than he dovetailed another into it, and so started
afresh.&nbsp; In this way he went on, until it was really quite
late in the night.&nbsp; At length he paused for a moment to
drink a cup of tea; he threw the beverage down his throat, and
was just clearing his throat to commence anew, when we started
up, offered to the head of the family a pinch of snuff, and,
having saluted the rest of the company, withdrew.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>You often meet in Tartary these Toolholos, or wandering
singers, who go about from tent to tent, celebrating in their
melodies national events and personages.&nbsp; They are generally
very poor; a violin and a flute, suspended from the girdle, are
their only property; but they are always received by the Mongol
families with kindness and honour; they often remain in one tent
for several days, and on their departure are supplied with
cheese, wine, tea, and so on, to support them on their way.&nbsp;
These poet-singers, who remind us of the minstrels and
rhapsodists of Greece, are also very numerous in China; but they
are, probably, no where so numerous or so popular as in
Thibet.</p>
<p>The day after the festival, the sun had scarcely risen, when a
little boy presented himself at the entrance of our tent,
carrying in one hand a wooden vessel full of milk, and in the
other hand a rude rush basket, in which were some new cheese and
some butter.&nbsp; He was followed soon after by an old Lama,
attended by a Tartar who had on his shoulder a large bag of
fuel.&nbsp; We invited them all to be seated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brothers of the West,&rdquo; said the Lama, &ldquo;accept
these trifling presents from my master.&rdquo;&nbsp; We bowed in
token of thanks, and Samdadchiemba hastened to prepare some tea,
which we pressed the Lama to stay and partake of.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will come and see you this evening,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I
cannot remain at present; for I have not set my pupil the prayer
he has to learn this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pupil in question
was the little boy who had brought the milk.&nbsp; The old man
then took his pupil by the hand, and they returned together to
their tent.</p>
<p>The old Lama was the preceptor of the family, and his function
consisted in directing the little boy in the study of the
Thibetian prayers.&nbsp; The education of the Tartars is very
limited.&nbsp; They who shave the head, the Lamas, are, as a
general rule, the only persons who learn to read and pray.&nbsp;
There is no such thing throughout the country as a public
school.&nbsp; With the exception of a few rich Mongols, who have
their children taught at home, all the young Lamas are obliged to
resort to the Lamaseries, wherein is concentrated all that exists
in Tartary, of arts, or sciences, or intellectual industry.&nbsp;
The Lama is not merely a priest; he is the painter, poet,
sculptor, architect, physician; the head, heart, and oracle of
the laity.&nbsp; The training of the young Mongols, who do not
resort to the Lamaseries, is limited, with the men, to perfecting
the use of the bow and arrow and matchlock, and to their
obtaining a thorough mastery of equestrianism.&nbsp; When a mere
infant the Mongol is weaned, and as soon as he is strong enough
he is stuck upon a horse&rsquo;s back behind a man, the animal is
put to a gallop, and the juvenile rider, in order not to fall
off, has to cling with both hands <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>to his
teacher&rsquo;s jacket.&nbsp; The Tartars thus become accustomed,
from a very early age, to the movements of the horse, and by
degrees and the force of habit, they identify themselves, as it
were, with the animal.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, no spectacle more exciting than that of
Mongol riders in chase of a wild horse.&nbsp; They are armed with
a long, heavy pole, at the end of which is a running knot.&nbsp;
They gallop, they fly after the horse they are pursuing down
rugged ravines, and up precipitous hills, in and out, twisting
and twining in their rapid course, until they come up with their
game.&nbsp; They then take the bridle of their own horses in
their teeth, seize with both hands their heavy pole, and bending
forward throw, by a powerful effort, the running knot round the
wild horse&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; In this exercise the greatest
vigour must be combined with the greatest dexterity, in order to
enable them to stop short the powerful untamed animals with which
they have to deal.&nbsp; It sometimes happens that pole and cord
are broken; but as to a horseman being thrown, it is an
occurrence we never saw or heard of.</p>
<p>The Mongol is so accustomed to horseback that he is altogether
like a fish out of water when he sets foot on the ground.&nbsp;
His step is heavy and awkward and his bowed legs, his chest bent
forward, his constant looking around him, all indicate a person
who spends the greater portion of his time on the back of a horse
or a camel.</p>
<p>When night overtakes the travelling Tartar, it often happens
that he will not even take the trouble to alight for the purpose
of repose.&nbsp; Ask people whom you meet in the desert where
they slept last night, and you will as frequently as not have for
answer, in a melancholy tone, &ldquo;<i>Temen dero</i>,&rdquo;
(on the camel).&nbsp; It is a singular spectacle to see caravans
halting at noon, when they come to a rich pasturage.&nbsp; The
camels disperse in all directions, browsing upon the high grass
of the prairie, while the Tartars, astride between the two humps
of the animal, sleep as profoundly as though they were sheltered
in a good bed.</p>
<p>This incessant activity, this constant travelling, contributes
to render the Tartars very vigorous, and capable of supporting
the most terrible cold, without appearing to be in the least
affected by it.&nbsp; In the deserts of Tartary, and especially
in the country of the Khalkhas, the cold is so intense, that for
a considerable portion of the winter the thermometer will not
act, on account of the congelation of the mercury.&nbsp; The
whole district is often covered with snow; and if at these times
the south-west wind blows, the plain wears the aspect of a raging
sea.&nbsp; The wind raises the snow in immense waves, and impels
the gigantic avalanches vehemently before it.&nbsp; Then the
Tartars hurry courageously to the aid of their herds and <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>flocks, and you see them dashing in all directions,
exciting the animals by their cries, and driving them to the
shelter of some rock or mountain.&nbsp; Sometimes these intrepid
shepherds stop short amid the tempest, and stand erect for a
time, as if defying the cold and the fury of the elements.</p>
<p>The training of the Tartar women is not more refined than that
of the men.&nbsp; They are not, indeed, taught the use of the bow
and the matchlock; but in equitation they are as expert and as
fearless as the men.&nbsp; Yet it is only on occasions that they
mount on horseback; such, for example, as travelling, or when
there is no man at home to go in search of a stray animal.&nbsp;
As a general rule, they have nothing to do with the care of the
herds and flocks.</p>
<p>Their chief occupation is to prepare the family meals, and to
make the family clothes.&nbsp; They are perfect mistresses of the
needle; it is they who fabricate the hats, boots, coats, and
other portions of the Mongol attire.&nbsp; The leather boots, for
example, which they make are not indeed very elegant in form,
but, on the other hand, their solidity is astonishing.</p>
<p>It was quite unintelligible to us how, with implements so rude
and coarse as theirs, they could manufacture articles almost
indestructible in their quality.&nbsp; It is true they take their
time about them; and get on very slowly with their work.&nbsp;
The Tartar women excel in embroidery, which, for taste and
variety of pattern and for excellence of manipulation, excited
our astonishment.&nbsp; We think we may venture to say, that no
where in France would you meet with embroidery more beautiful and
more perfect in fabric than that we have seen in Tartary.</p>
<p>The Tartars do not use the needle in the same way as the
Chinese.&nbsp; In China they impel the needle perpendicularly
down and up; whereas the Tartars impel it perpendicularly up and
down.&nbsp; In France the manner is different from both; if we
recollect right, the French women impel the needle horizontally
from right to left.&nbsp; We will not attempt to pronounce as to
the respective merit of the three methods; we will leave the
point to the decision of the respectable fraternity of
tailors.</p>
<p>On the 17th of the moon, we proceeded very early in the
morning to the Chinese station of <i>Chabort&eacute;</i>, for the
purpose of laying in a store of meal.&nbsp;
<i>Chabort&eacute;</i>, as its Mongol name intimates, is built
upon a slough.&nbsp; The houses are all made of mud, and
surrounded each by an enclosure of high walls.&nbsp; The streets
are irregular, tortuous, and narrow; the aspect of the whole town
is sombre and sinister, and the Chinese who inhabit it have, if
possible, a more knavish look than their countrymen anywhere
else.&nbsp; The trade of the town comprehends all the articles in
ordinary use with the <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Mongols&mdash;oatmeal and millet,
cotton manufactures, and brick tea, which the Tartars receive in
exchange for the products of the desert, salt, mushrooms, and
furs.&nbsp; Upon our return, we hastened to prepare for our
departure.&nbsp; While we were packing up our baggage in the
tent, Samdadchiemba went in search of the animals which had been
put to pasture in the vicinity.&nbsp; A moment afterwards he
returned with the three camels.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are the
camels,&rdquo; said we, with gloomy anticipation, &ldquo;but
where are the horse and the mule; they were both at hand just
now, for we tied their legs to prevent their
straying.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are stolen, in all
probability.&nbsp; It never does to encamp too near the Chinese,
whom every body knows to be arrant horse stealers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These words came upon us like a clap of thunder.&nbsp; However,
it was not a moment for sterile lamentation; it was necessary to
go in search of the thieves.&nbsp; We each mounted a camel, and
made a circuit in search of the animals, leaving our tent under
the charge of Arsalan.&nbsp; Our search being futile, we resolved
to proceed to the Mongol encampment, and inform them that the
animals had been lost near their habitation.</p>
<p>By a law among the Tartars, when animals are lost from a
caravan, the persons occupying the nearest encampment are bound
either to find them or to replace them.&nbsp; It seems, no doubt,
very strange to European views, that because, without their
consent or even knowledge, without being in the smallest degree
known to them, you have chosen to pitch your tent near those of a
Mongol party, you and your animals, and your baggage, are to be
under their responsibility; but so it is.&nbsp; If a thing
disappears, the law supposes that your next neighbour is the
thief; or at all events an accomplice.&nbsp; This it is which has
contributed to render the Mongols so skilful in tracking
animals.&nbsp; A mere glance at the slight traces left by an
animal upon the grass, suffices to inform the Mongol pursuer how
long since it passed, and whether or not it bore a rider; and the
track once found, they follow it throughout all its meanderings,
however complicated.</p>
<p>We had no sooner explained our loss to the Mongol chief, than
he said to us cheerfully: &ldquo;Sirs Lamas, do not permit sorrow
to invade your hearts.&nbsp; Your animals cannot be lost; in
these plains there are neither robbers nor associates of
robbers.&nbsp; I will send in quest of your horses.&nbsp; If we
do not find them, you may select what others you please in their
place, from our herd.&nbsp; We would have you leave this place as
happy as you came to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; While he was speaking eight
of his people mounted on horseback, and dashed off in as many
directions, upon the quest, each man trailing after him his
lasso, attached to the long, flexible pole we have
described.&nbsp; After a while they all collected in one body,
and galloped away, as <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>hard as they could, towards the
town.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are on the track now, holy sirs,&rdquo;
said the chief, who was watching their movements by our sides,
&ldquo;and you will have your horses back very soon.&nbsp;
Meanwhile come within my tent, and drink some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In about two hours, a boy appeared at the entrance of the
tent, and announced the return of the horsemen.&nbsp; We hastened
outside, and in the track which we had pursued saw something amid
a cloud of dust which seemed horsemen galloping like the
wind.&nbsp; We presently discovered the eight Tartars, dashing
along, like so many mad centaurs, our stray animals, each held by
a lasso, in the midst of them.&nbsp; On their arrival, they
alighted, and with an air of satisfaction said: &ldquo;We told
you nothing was ever lost in our country.&rdquo;&nbsp; We thanked
the generous Mongols for the great service they had rendered us;
and, bidding adieu to them, saddled our horses, and departed on
our way to the Blue City.</p>
<p>On the third day we came, in the solitude, upon an imposing
and majestic monument of antiquity,&mdash;a large city utterly
abandoned.&nbsp; Its turreted ramparts, its watch towers, its
four great gates, facing the four cardinal points, were all there
perfect, in preservation, except that, besides being
three-fourths buried in the soil, they were covered with a thick
coating of turf.&nbsp; Arrived opposite the southern gate, we
directed Samdadchiemba to proceed quietly with the animals, while
we paid a visit to the Old Town, as the Tartars designate
it.&nbsp; Our impression, as we entered the vast enclosure, was
one of mingled awe and sadness.&nbsp; There were no ruins of any
sort to be seen, but only the outline of a large and fine town,
becoming absorbed below by gradual accumulations of wind-borne
soil, and above by a winding-sheet of turf.&nbsp; The arrangement
of the streets and the position of the principal edifices, were
indicated by the inequalities of ground.&nbsp; The only living
things we found here were a young Mongol shepherd, silently
smoking his pipe, and the flock of goats he tended.&nbsp; We
questioned the former as to when the city was built, by whom,
when abandoned, and why?&nbsp; We might as well have interrogated
his goats; he knew no more than that the place was called the Old
Town.</p>
<p>Such remains of ancient cities are of no unfrequent occurrence
in the deserts of Mongolia; but everything connected with their
origin and history is buried in darkness.&nbsp; Oh, with what
sadness does such a spectacle fill the soul!&nbsp; The ruins of
Greece, the superb remains of Egypt,&mdash;all these, it is true,
tell of death; all belong to the past; yet when you gaze upon
them, you know what they are; you can retrace, in memory, the
revolutions which have occasioned the ruins and the decay of the
country around them.&nbsp; Descend into the tomb, wherein was
buried alive the city of <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Herculaneum,&mdash;you find there, it is true, a
gigantic skeleton, but you have within you historical
associations wherewith to galvanize it.&nbsp; But of these old
abandoned cities of Tartary, not a tradition remains; they are
tombs without an epitaph, amid solitude and silence,
uninterrupted except when the wandering Tartars halt, for a
while, within the ruined enclosures, because there the pastures
are richer and more abundant.</p>
<p>Although, however, nothing positive can be stated respecting
these remains, the probabilities are, that they date no earlier
back than the 13th century, the period when the Mongols rendered
themselves masters of the Chinese empire, of which they retained
possession for more than 100 years.&nbsp; During their
domination, say the Chinese annals, they erected in Northern
Tartary many large and powerful cities.&nbsp; Towards the middle
of the 14th century the Mongol dynasty was expelled from China;
the Emperor <i>Young-Lo</i>, who desired to exterminate the
Tartars, invaded their country, and burned their towns, making no
fewer than three expeditions against them into the desert, 200
leagues north of the Great Wall.</p>
<p>After leaving behind us the Old Town, we came to a broad road
crossing N.S. that along which we were travelling E.W.&nbsp; This
road, the ordinary route of the Russian embassies to Peking, is
called by the Tartars <i>Koutcheou-Dcham</i> (Road of the
Emperor&rsquo;s Daughter), because it was constructed for the
passage of a princess, whom one of the Celestial Emperors
bestowed upon a King of the Khalkhas.&nbsp; After traversing the
<i>Tchakar</i> and <i>Western Souniot</i>, it enters the country
of the <i>Khalkhas</i> by the kingdom of <i>Mourguevan</i>;
thence crossing N.S. the great desert of Gobi, it traverses the
river <i>Toula</i>, near the <i>Great Couren</i>, and terminates
with the Russian factories at <i>Kiaktha</i>.</p>
<p>This town, under a treaty of peace in 1688 between the Emperor
<i>Khang-Hi</i>, and the <i>White Khan of the Oros</i>, i.e. the
Czar of Russia, was established as the entrep&ocirc;t of the
trade between the two countries.&nbsp; Its northern portion is
occupied by the Russian factories, its southern by the
Tartaro-Chinese.&nbsp; The intermediate space is a neutral
ground, devoted to the purposes of commerce.&nbsp; The Russians
are not permitted to enter the Chinese quarter, nor the Chinese
the Russian.&nbsp; The commerce of the town is considerable, and
apparently very beneficial to both parties.&nbsp; The Russians
bring linen goods, cloths, velvets, soaps, and hardware; the
Chinese tea in bricks, of which the Russians use large
quantities; and these Chinese tea-bricks being taken in payment
of the Russian goods at an easy rate, linen goods are sold in
China at a lower rate than even in Europe itself.&nbsp; It is
owing to their ignorance of this commerce of Russia with China
that speculators at Canton so frequently find no market for their
commodities.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Under another treaty of peace between the two powers,
signed 14th of June, 1728, by Count Vladislavitch, Ambassador
Extraordinary of Russia, on the one part, and by the Minister of
the Court of Peking on the other, the Russian government
maintains, in the capital of the celestial empire, a monastery,
to which is attached a school, wherein a certain number of young
Russians qualify themselves as Chinese and Tartar-Mantchou
interpreters.&nbsp; Every ten years, the pupils, having completed
their studies, return with their spiritual pastors of the
monastery to St. Petersburg, and are relieved by a new
settlement.&nbsp; The little caravan is commanded by a Russian
officer, who has it in charge to conduct the new disciples to
Peking, and bring back the students and the members who have
completed their period.&nbsp; From Kiaktha to Peking the Russians
travel at the expense of the Chinese government, and are escorted
from station to station by Tartar troops.</p>
<p>M. Timkouski, who in 1820 had charge of the Russian caravan to
Peking, tells us, in his account of the journey, that he could
never make out why the Chinese guides led him by a different
route from that which the preceding ambassadors had
pursued.&nbsp; The Tartars explained the matter to us.&nbsp; They
said it was a political precaution of the Chinese government, who
conceived that, being taken by all sorts of roundabout paths and
no-paths, the Russians might be kept from a knowledge of the
regular route;&mdash;an immensely imbecile precaution, since the
Autocrat of all the Russians would not have the slightest
difficulty in leading his armies to Peking, should he ever take a
fancy to go and beard the Son of Heaven in his celestial
seat.</p>
<p>This road to Kiaktha, which we thus came upon unexpectedly
amid the deserts of Tartary, created a deep emotion in our
hearts: &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said we to each other, &ldquo;here is
a road which leads to Europe!&rdquo;&nbsp; Our native land
presented itself before our imagination, and we spontaneously
entered upon the road, which connected us with our beloved
France.&nbsp; The conversation that rose to our lips from our
hearts was so pleasing, that we insensibly advanced.&nbsp; The
sight of some Mongol tents, on an adjacent eminence, recalled us
to a sense of our position, and at the same moment a loud cry
came from a Tartar whom we saw gesticulating in front of the
tents.&nbsp; Not understanding the cry to be addressed to us, we
turned, and were proceeding on our route, whet the Tartar,
jumping on his horse, galloped after us; upon reaching us, he
alighted and knelt before us: &ldquo;Holy sirs,&rdquo; said he,
raising his hands before Heaven, &ldquo;have pity upon me, and
save my mother from death.&nbsp; I know your power is infinite:
come and preserve my mother by your prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
parable of the good Samaritan came before us, and <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>we
felt that charity forbade us to pass on without doing all we
could in the matter.&nbsp; We therefore turned once more, in
order to encamp near the Tartars.</p>
<p>While Samdadchiemba arranged our tent, we went, without loss
of time, to tend the sick woman, whom we found in a very
deplorable state.&nbsp; &ldquo;Inhabitants of the desert,&rdquo;
said we to her friends, &ldquo;we know not the use of simples, we
are unacquainted with the secrets of life, but we will pray to
Jehovah for this sick person.&nbsp; You have not heard of this
Almighty God&mdash;your Lamas know him not; but, be assured,
Jehovah is the master of life and of death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Circumstances did not permit us to dwell on the theme to these
poor people, who, absorbed in grief and anxiety, could pay little
attention to our words.&nbsp; We returned to our tent to pray,
the Tartar accompanying us.&nbsp; When he saw our Breviary:
&ldquo;Are these,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;the all-powerful
prayers to Jehovah, of which you spoke?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said we; &ldquo;these are the only true
prayers; the only prayers that can save.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon
he prostrated himself successively before each of us, touching
the ground with his forehead; then he took the Breviary, and
raised it to his head in token of respect.&nbsp; During our
recitation of the prayers for the sick, the Tartar remained
seated at the entrance of the tent, preserving a profound and
religious silence.&nbsp; When we had finished, &ldquo;Holy
men,&rdquo; said he, again prostrating himself, &ldquo;how can I
make acknowledgments for your great benefits?&nbsp; I am poor; I
can offer you neither horse nor sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mongol
brother,&rdquo; we replied, &ldquo;the priests of Jehovah may not
offer up prayers for the sake of enriching themselves; since thou
art not rich, accept from us this trifling gift;&rdquo; and we
presented to him a fragment of a tea-brick.&nbsp; The Tartar was
profoundly moved with this proceeding; he could not say a word,
his only answer to us was tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>We heard next morning with pleasure that the Tartar woman was
much better.&nbsp; We would fain have remained a few days in the
place, in order to cultivate the germ of the true faith thus
planted in the bosom of this family; but we were compelled to
proceed.&nbsp; Some of the Tartars escorted us a short distance
on our way.</p>
<p>Medicine in Tartary, as we have already observed, is
exclusively practised by the Lamas.&nbsp; When illness attacks
any one, his friends run to the nearest monastery for a Lama,
whose first proceeding, upon visiting the patient, is to run his
fingers over the pulse of both wrists simultaneously, as the
fingers of a musician run over the strings of an
instrument.&nbsp; The Chinese physicians feel both pulses also,
but in succession.&nbsp; After due deliberation, the Lama
pronounces his opinion as to the particular nature of the
malady.&nbsp; According to the religious belief of the Tartars,
all illness is owing <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>to the visitation of a
<i>Tchutgour</i> or demon; but the expulsion of the demon is
first a matter of medicine.&nbsp; The Lama physician next
proceeds, as Lama apothecary, to give the specific befitting the
case; the Tartar pharmacop&oelig;ia rejecting all mineral
chemistry, the Lama remedies consist entirely of vegetables
pulverised, and either infused in water or made up into
pills.&nbsp; If the Lama doctor happens not to have any medicine
with him, he is by no means disconcerted; he writes the names of
the remedies upon little scraps of paper, moistens the papers
with his saliva, and rolls them up into pills, which the patient
tosses down with the same perfect confidence as though they were
genuine medicaments.&nbsp; To swallow the name of a remedy, or
the remedy itself, say the Tartars, comes to precisely the same
thing.</p>
<p>The medical assault of the usurping demon being applied, the
Lama next proceeds to spiritual artillery, in the form of
prayers, adapted to the quality of the demon who has to be
dislodged.&nbsp; If the patient is poor, the <i>Tchutgour</i>
visiting him can evidently be only an inferior <i>Tchutgour</i>,
requiring merely a brief, off-hand prayer, sometimes merely an
interjectional exorcism.&nbsp; If the patient is very poor, the
Lama troubles himself with neither prayer nor pill, but goes
away, recommending the friends to wait with patience until the
sick person gets better or dies, according to the decree of
<i>Hormoustha</i>.&nbsp; But where the patient is rich, the
possessor of large flocks, the proceedings are altogether
different.&nbsp; First, it is obvious that a devil who presumes
to visit so eminent a personage must be a potent devil, one of
the chiefs of the lower world; and it would not be decent for a
great <i>Tchutgour</i> to travel like a mere sprite; the family,
accordingly, are directed to prepare for him a handsome suit of
clothes, a pair of rich boots, a fine horse, ready saddled and
bridled, otherwise the devil will never think of going, physic or
exorcise him how you may.&nbsp; It is even possible, indeed, that
one horse will not suffice, for the demon, in very rich cases,
may turn out, upon inquiry, to be so high and mighty a prince,
that he has with him a number of courtiers and attendants, all of
whom have to be provided with horses.</p>
<p>Everything being arranged, the ceremony commences.&nbsp; The
Lama and numerous co-physicians called in from his own and other
adjacent monasteries, offer up prayers in the rich man&rsquo;s
tents for a week or a fortnight, until they perceive that the
devil is gone&mdash;that is to say, until they have exhausted all
the disposable tea and sheep.&nbsp; If the patient recovers, it
is a clear proof that the prayers have been efficaciously
recited; if he dies, it is a still greater proof of the
efficaciousness of the prayers, for not only is the devil gone,
but the patient has transmigrated to a state far better than that
he has quitted.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>The prayers recited by the Lamas for the recovery of the
sick are sometimes accompanied with very dismal and alarming
rites.&nbsp; The aunt of Tokoura, chief of an encampment in the
Valley of Dark Waters, visited by M. Huc, was seized one evening
with an intermittent fever.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would invite the
attendance of the doctor Lama,&rdquo; said Tokoura, &ldquo;but if
he finds that there is a very big <i>Tchutgour</i> present, the
expenses will ruin me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He waited for some days; but
as his aunt grew worse and worse, he at last sent for a Lama; his
anticipations were confirmed.&nbsp; The Lama pronounced that a
demon of considerable rank was present, and that no time must be
lost in expelling him.&nbsp; Eight other Lamas were forthwith
called in, who at once set about the construction, in dried
herbs, of a great puppet, which they entitled the <i>Demon of
Intermittent Fevers</i>, and which, when completed, they placed
on its legs by means of a stick, in the patient&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>The ceremony began at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night; the Lamas
ranged themselves in a semicircle round the upper portion of the
tent, with cymbals, sea-shells, bells, tambourines, and other
instruments of the noisy Tartar music.&nbsp; The remainder of the
circle was completed by the members of the family, squatting on
the ground close to one another, the patient kneeling, or rather
crouched on her heels, opposite the <i>Demon of Intermittent
Fevers</i>.&nbsp; The Lama doctor-in-chief had before him a large
copper basin filled with millet, and some little images made of
paste.&nbsp; The dung-fuel threw, amid much smoke, a fantastic
and quivering light over the strange scene.</p>
<p>Upon a given signal, the clerical orchestra executed an
overture harsh enough to frighten Satan himself, the lay
congregation beating time with their hands to the charivari of
clanging instruments and ear-splitting voices.&nbsp; The
diabolical concert over, the Grand Lama opened the Book of
Exorcisms, which he rested on his knees.&nbsp; As he chanted one
of the forms, he took from the basin, from time to time, a
handful of millet, which he threw east, west, north, and south,
according to the Rubric.&nbsp; The tones of his voice, as he
prayed, were sometimes mournful and suppressed, sometimes
vehemently loud and energetic.&nbsp; All of a sudden, he would
quit the regular cadence of prayer, and have an outburst of
apparently indomitable rage, abusing the herb puppet with fierce
invectives and furious gestures.&nbsp; The exorcism terminated,
he gave a signal by stretching out his arms, right and left, and
the other Lamas struck up a tremendously noisy chorus, in
hurried, dashing tones; all the instruments were set to work, and
meantime the lay congregation, having started up with one accord,
ran out of the tent, one after the other, and tearing round it
like mad people, beat <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>it at their hardest with sticks,
yelling all the while at the pitch of their voices in a manner to
make ordinary hair stand on end.&nbsp; Having thrice performed
this demoniac round, they re-entered the tent as precipitately as
they had quitted it, and resumed their seats.&nbsp; Then, all the
others covering their faces with their hands, the Grand Lama rose
and set fire to the herb figure.&nbsp; As soon as the flames
rose, he uttered a loud cry, which was repeated with interest by
the rest of the company.&nbsp; The laity immediately rose, seized
the burning figure, carried it into the plain, away from the
tents, and there, as it consumed, anathematized it with all sorts
of imprecations; the Lamas meantime squatted in the tent,
tranquilly chanting their prayers in a grave, solemn tone.</p>
<p>Upon the return of the family from their valorous expedition,
the praying was exchanged for joyous felicitations.&nbsp;
By-and-by, each person provided with a lighted torch, the whole
party rushed simultaneously from the tent, and formed into a
procession, the laymen first, then the patient, supported on
either side by a member of the family, and lastly, the nine
Lamas, making night hideous with their music.&nbsp; In this style
the patient was conducted to another tent, pursuant to the orders
of the Lama, who had declared that she must absent herself from
her own habitation for an entire month.</p>
<p>After this strange treatment, the malady did not return.&nbsp;
The probability is, that the Lamas, having ascertained the
precise moment at which the fever-fit would recur, met it at the
exact point of time by this tremendous counter-excitement, and
overcame it.</p>
<p>Though the majority of the Lamas seek to foster the ignorant
credulity of the Tartars, in order to turn it to their own
profit, we have met some of them who frankly avowed that
duplicity and imposture played considerable part in all their
ceremonies.&nbsp; The superior of a Lamasery said to us one day:
&ldquo;When a person is ill, the recitation of prayers is proper,
for Buddha is the master of life and death; it is he who rules
the transmigration of beings.&nbsp; To take remedies is also
fitting, for the great virtue of medicinal herbs also comes to us
from Buddha.&nbsp; That the Evil One may possess a rich person is
credible, but that, in order to repel the Evil One, the way is to
give him dress, and a horse, and what not, this is a fiction
invented by ignorant and deceiving Lamas, who desire to
accumulate wealth at the expense of their brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manner of interring the dead among the Tartars is not
uniform.&nbsp; The Lamas are only called in to assist at
extremely grand funerals.&nbsp; Towards the Great Wall, where the
Mongols are mixed up with the Chinese, the custom of the latter
in this particular, as in others, has insensibly prevailed.&nbsp;
There the corpse is placed, <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>after the
Chinese fashion, in a coffin, and the coffin in a grave.&nbsp; In
the desert, among the true nomadic tribes, the entire ceremony
consists in conveying the dead to the tops of hills or the
bottoms of ravines, there to be devoured by the birds and beasts
of prey.&nbsp; It is really horrible to travellers through the
deserts of Tartary to see, as they constantly do, human remains,
for which the eagles and the wolves are contending.</p>
<p>The richer Tartars sometimes burn their dead with great
solemnity.&nbsp; A large furnace of earth is constructed in a
pyramidical form.&nbsp; Just before it is completed, the body is
placed inside, standing, surrounded with combustibles.&nbsp; The
edifice is then completely covered in, with the exception of a
small hole at the bottom to admit fire, and another at the top,
to give egress to the smoke, and keep up a current of air.&nbsp;
During the combustion, the Lamas stir round the tomb and recite
prayers.&nbsp; The corpse being burnt, they demolish the furnace
and remove the bones, which they carry to the Grand Lama; he
reduces them to a very fine powder, and having added to them an
equal quantity of meal, he kneads the whole with care, and
constructs, with his own hands, cakes of different sizes, which
he places one upon the other, in the form of a pyramid.&nbsp;
When the bones have been thus prepared by the Grand Lama, they
are transported with great pomp to a little tower built
beforehand, in a place indicated by the diviner.</p>
<p>They almost always give to the ashes of the Lamas a sepulture
of this description.&nbsp; You meet with a great number of these
monumental towers on the summits of the mountains, and in the
neighbourhood of the Lamaseries; and you may find them in
countries whence the Mongols have been driven by the
Chinese.&nbsp; In other respects these countries scarcely retain
any trace of the Tartars: the Lamaseries, the pasturages, the
shepherds, with their tents and flocks, all have disappeared, to
make room for new people, new monuments, new customs.&nbsp; A few
small towers raised over graves alone remain there, as if to
assert the rights of the ancient possessors of these lands, and
to protest against the invasion of the Kitat.</p>
<p>The most celebrated seat of Mongol burials is in the province
of Chan-Si, at the famous Lamasery of Five Towers
(<i>Ou-Tay</i>).&nbsp; According to the Tartars, the Lamasery of
the Five Towers is the best place you can be buried in.&nbsp; The
ground in it is so holy, that those who are so fortunate as to be
interred there are certain of a happy transmigration
thence.&nbsp; The marvellous sanctity of this place is attributed
to the presence of Buddha, who for some centuries past has taken
up his abode there in the interior of a mountain.&nbsp; In 1842
the noble Tokoura, of whom we have already had <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>occasion to
speak, conveying the bones of his father and mother to the Five
Towers, had the infinite happiness to behold there the venerable
Buddha.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behind the great monastery,&rdquo; he told
us, &ldquo;there is a very lofty mountain, which you must climb
by creeping on your hands and feet.&nbsp; Just towards the summit
you come to a portico cut in the rock; you lie down on the earth,
and look through a small aperture not larger than the bowl of a
pipe.&nbsp; It is some time before you can distinguish anything,
but by degrees your eye gets used to the place, and you have the
happiness of beholding, at length, in the depths of the mountain,
the face of the ancient Buddha.&nbsp; He is seated cross-legged,
doing nothing.&nbsp; There are around him Lamas of all countries,
who are continually paying homage to him.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Whatever you may think of Tokoura&rsquo;s narrative, it is
certain that the Tartars and the Thibetians have given themselves
up to an inconceivable degree of fanaticism, in reference to the
Lamasery of the Five Towers.&nbsp; You frequently meet, in the
deserts of Tartary, Mongols, carrying on their shoulders the
bones of their parents, to the Five Towers, to purchase, almost
at its weight in gold, a few feet of earth, whereon they may
raise a small mausoleum.&nbsp; Even the Mongols of Torgot perform
journeys occupying a whole <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>year, and
attended with immense difficulty, to visit for this purpose the
province of Chan-Si.</p>
<p>The Tartar kings sometimes make use of a sepulture which is
the height of extravagance and barbarism.&nbsp; The royal corpse
is conveyed to a vast edifice, constructed of bricks, and adorned
with numerous statues representing men, lions, elephants, tigers,
and various subjects of Buddhic mythology.&nbsp; With the
illustrious defunct, they bury in a large cavern, constructed in
the centre of the building, large sums of gold and silver, royal
robes, precious stones, in short, every thing which he may need
in another life.&nbsp; These monstrous interments sometimes cost
the lives of a great number of slaves.&nbsp; They take children
of both sexes, remarkable for their beauty, and make them swallow
mercury till they are suffocated; in this way they preserve, they
say, the freshness and ruddiness of their countenance, so as to
make them appear still alive.&nbsp; These unfortunate victims are
placed upright, round the corpse of their master, continuing, in
this fashion, to serve him as during life.&nbsp; They hold in
their hands the pipe, fan, the small phial of snuff, and the
numerous other nick-nacks of the Tartar kings.</p>
<p>To protect these buried treasures, they place in the cavern a
kind of bow, capable of discharging a number of arrows, one after
the other.&nbsp; This bow, or rather these several bows joined
together, are all bent, and the arrows ready to fly.&nbsp; They
place this infernal machine in such a manner that, on opening the
door of the cavern, the movement causes the discharge of the
first arrow at the man who enters; the discharge of the first
arrow causes the discharge of the second, and so on to the
last&mdash;so that the unlucky person, whom covetousness or
curiosity should induce to open the door, would fall, pierced
with many arrows, in the tomb he sought to profane.&nbsp; They
sell these murderous machines ready prepared by the
bow-makers.&nbsp; The Chinese sometimes purchase them, to guard
their houses in their absence.</p>
<p>After a march of two days, we entered the district called the
Kingdom of Efe; it is a portion of the territory of the Eight
Banners, which the Emperor Kien-Long dismembered in favour of a
prince of the Khalkhas.&nbsp; <i>Sun-Tch&eacute;</i>, founder of
the Mantchou dynasty, laid down this maxim: &ldquo;In the south,
establish no kings; in the north, interrupt no
alliances.&rdquo;&nbsp; This policy has ever since been exactly
pursued by the court of Peking.&nbsp; The Emperor Kien-Long, in
order to attach to his dynasty the prince in question, gave him
his daughter in marriage, hoping by this means to fix him at
Peking, and thus to weaken the still dreaded power of the Khalkha
sovereigns.&nbsp; He built for him, within the circuit of the
Yellow <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Town itself, a large and magnificent
palace, but the Mongol prince could not adapt or reconcile
himself to the stiff arbitrary etiquette of a court.&nbsp; Amid
the pomp and luxury accumulated for his entertainment, he was
incessantly absorbed with the thought of his tents and his herds:
even the snows and frosts of his country were matters of
regret.&nbsp; The attentions of the court being altogether
inadequate to the dissipation of his ennui, he began to talk
about returning to his prairies in the Khalkhas.&nbsp; On the
other hand, his young wife, accustomed to the refinements of the
court of Peking, could not bear the idea of spending the rest of
her days in the desert, amongst milkmaids and shepherds.&nbsp;
The Emperor resorted to a compromise which sufficiently met the
wishes of his son-in-law, without too violently disconcerting the
feelings of his daughter.&nbsp; He dismembered a portion of the
<i>Tchakar</i>, and assigned it to the Mongol prince; he built
for him, amid these solitudes, a small but handsome city, and
presented to him a hundred families of slaves skilled in the arts
and manufactures of China.&nbsp; In this manner, while the young
Mantchou princess was enabled to dwell in a city and to have a
court, the Mongol prince, on his part, was in a position to enjoy
the tranquillity of the Land of Grass, and to resume at will the
pleasures of nomadic life, in which he had passed his
boyhood.</p>
<p>The King of Efe brought with him into his petty dominions a
great number of Mongol Khalkhas, who inhabit, under the tent, the
country bestowed upon their prince.&nbsp; These Tartars fully
maintain the reputation for strength and active vigour which is
generally attributed to the men of their nation.&nbsp; They are
considered the most powerful wrestlers in southern
Mongolia.&nbsp; From their infancy, they are trained to gymnastic
exercises, and at the public wrestling matches, celebrated every
year at Peking, a great number of these men attend to compete for
the prizes, and to sustain the reputation of their country.&nbsp;
Yet, though far superior in strength to the Chinese, they are
sometimes thrown by the latter, generally more active, and
especially more tricky.</p>
<p>In the great match of 1843, a wrestler of the kingdom of Efe
had overthrown all competitors, Tartars and Chinese.&nbsp; His
body, of gigantic proportions, was fixed upon legs which seemed
immovable columns; his hands, like great grappling irons, seized
his antagonists, raised them, and then hurled them to the ground,
almost without effort.&nbsp; No person had been at all able to
stand before his prodigious strength, and they were about to
assign him the prize, when a Chinese stepped into the ring.&nbsp;
He was short, small, meagre, and appeared calculated for no other
purpose than to augment the number of the Efeian&rsquo;s
victims.&nbsp; He advanced, however, with an air of firm
confidence; the Goliath of Efe stretched out his brawny <!-- page
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>arms
to grasp him, when the Chinese, who had his mouth full of water,
suddenly discharged the liquid in the giant&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
The Tartar mechanically raised his hands to wipe his eyes, and at
the instant, the cunning Chinese rushed in, caught him round the
waist, threw him off his balance, and down he went, amid the
convulsive laughter of the spectators.</p>
<p>This anecdote was told to us by a Tartar horseman who
travelled with us a part of our way through the kingdom of
Efe.&nbsp; From time to time he showed us children engaged in
wrestling.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the
favourite exercise with all the inhabitants of our kingdom of
Efe.&nbsp; We esteem in a man but two things,&mdash;his being a
good horseman and his being a good wrestler.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was one group of youthful wrestlers whom, exercising as they were
on the side of our road, we were enabled to watch closely and at
leisure; their ardour redoubled when they saw we were looking at
them.&nbsp; The tallest of the party, who did not seem more than
eight or nine years old, took in his arms one of his companions,
nearly his own height, and very fat, and amused himself with
tossing him above his head, and catching him again, as you would
a ball.&nbsp; He repeated this feat seven or eight times, and at
every repetition we trembled for the life of the boy; but the
rest of the children only gambolled about, applauding the success
of the performers.</p>
<p>On the 22nd day of the eighth moon, on quitting the petty
kingdom of Efe, we ascended a mountain, on the sides of which
grew thickets of fir and birch.&nbsp; The sight of these at first
gave us great pleasure.&nbsp; The deserts of Tartary are in
general so monotonously bare, that you cannot fail to experience
a pleasurable sensation when you come upon some occasional trees
on your way.&nbsp; Our first feelings of joy were, however, soon
demolished by a sentiment of a very different nature; we were as
though frozen with horror, on perceiving at a turn of the
mountain, three enormous wolves, that seemed awaiting us with
calm intrepidity.&nbsp; At sight of these villainous beasts we
stopped suddenly and as it were instinctively.&nbsp; After a
moment of general stupor, Samdadchiemba descended from his mule,
and wrung the noses of our camels.&nbsp; The expedient succeeded
marvellously; the poor beasts sent forth such piercing and
terrible cries, that the scared wolves dashed off with all
speed.&nbsp; Arsalan, who saw them flee, thinking undoubtedly
that it was himself they were afraid of, pursued them at the
utmost speed of his legs; soon the wolves turned round, and our
tent-porter would have been infallibly devoured had not M. Gabet
rushed to his aid, uttering loud cries, and wringing the nose of
his camel; the wolves having taken flight a second time,
disappeared without our again thinking of pursuing them.</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>Although the want of population might seem to abandon
the interminable deserts of Tartary to wild beasts, wolves are
rarely met with.&nbsp; This arises, no doubt, from the incessant
and vindictive warfare which the Mongols wage against them.&nbsp;
They pursue them, everywhere, to the death, regarding them as
their capital enemy, on account of the great damage they may
inflict upon their flocks.&nbsp; The announcement that a wolf has
made its appearance in a neighbourhood, is for every one a signal
to mount his horse.&nbsp; As there are always near each tent
horses ready saddled, in an instant the plain is covered with
numerous cavalry, all armed with their long lasso-pole.&nbsp; The
wolf in vain flees in every direction: it meets everywhere
horsemen who rush upon it.&nbsp; There is no mountain so rugged
or arduous, up which the Tartar horses, agile as goats, cannot
pursue it.&nbsp; The horseman who is at length successful in
passing round its neck the running knot, gallops off at full
speed, dragging the wolf after him to the nearest tent; there
they strongly bind its muzzle, so that they may torture it
securely; and then, by way of finale, skin it alive, and turn it
off.&nbsp; In summer, the wretched brute lives in this condition
several days; but in winter, exposed without a skin to the
rigours of the season, it dies forthwith, frozen with cold.</p>
<p>Some short time after we had lost sight of our three wolves,
we had a singular encounter enough.&nbsp; We saw advancing
towards us, on the same road, two chariots each drawn by three
oxen.&nbsp; To each chariot were fastened, with great iron
chains, twelve dogs of a terrible and ferocious aspect, four on
each side, and four behind.&nbsp; These carriages were laden with
square boxes, painted red; the drivers sat on the boxes.&nbsp; We
could not conjecture what was the nature of the load, on account
of which they thought it essential to have this horrible escort
of Cerberuses.&nbsp; In accordance with the customs of the
country, we could not question them on this point.&nbsp; The
slightest indiscretion would have made us pass in their eyes for
people actuated by evil intentions.&nbsp; We contented ourselves
with asking if we were still very far from the monastery of
Tchortchi, where we hoped to arrive that day; but the baying of
the dogs, and the clanking of their chains, prevented us from
hearing the answer.</p>
<p>As we were going through the hollow of a valley, we remarked
on the summit of an elevated mountain before us a long line of
objects without motion, and of an indefinite form.&nbsp;
By-and-by these objects seemed to resemble a formidable battery
of cannons, ranged in line, and the nearer we advanced, the more
were we confirmed in this impression.&nbsp; We felt sure that we
saw distinctly the wheels of the carriages, the sponge-rods, the
mouths of the cannons pointed towards the plain.&nbsp; But how
could we bring ourselves to <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>think that an
army, with all its train of artillery could be there in the
desert, amidst this profound solitude?&nbsp; Giving way to a
thousand extravagant conjectures, we hastened our progress,
impatient to examine this strange apparition closely.&nbsp; Our
illusion was only completely dissipated when we arrived quite at
the top of the mountain.&nbsp; What we had taken for a battery of
cannons was a long caravan of little Mongol chariots.&nbsp; We
laughed at our mistake, but the illusion was not an unnatural
one.&nbsp; These small two-wheeled chariots were all standing
still on their frames, each laden with a sack of salt, covered
with a mat, the ends of which extended beyond the extremities of
the sacks, so as to resemble exactly the mouths of cannon; the
Mongol waggoners were boiling their tea in the open air, whilst
their oxen were feeding on the sides of the mountain.&nbsp; The
transport of merchandise, across the deserts of Tartary, is
ordinarily effected, in default of camels, by these small
two-wheeled chariots.&nbsp; A few bars of rough wood are the only
materials that enter into their construction, and they are so
light that a child may lift them with ease.&nbsp; The oxen that
draw them, have all a little iron ring passed through their
nostrils; to this ring is a cord, which attaches the animal to
the preceding chariot; thus all the carriages, from the first to
the last, are connected together, and form a long uninterrupted
line.&nbsp; The Mongol waggoners are generally seated on the
oxen, very rarely on the carriage, and scarcely ever on
foot.&nbsp; On all the chief roads you meet with these long lines
of carriages, and long before you see them, you hear the
lugubrious and monotonous sound of the great iron bells, which
the oxen carry suspended from their neck.</p>
<p>After drinking a cup of tea with the Mongols whom we had met
in the mountain, we proceeded on our way; the sun was on the
point of setting, when we set up our tent on the margin of a
stream about a hundred yards from the Lamasery of Tchortchi.</p>

<p>Although we had never visited the Lamasery of Tchortchi, we,
nevertheless, knew a good deal about it from the information that
had been given us.&nbsp; It was here that the young Lama was
educated who came to teach M. Gabet the Mongol language, and
whose conversion to Christianity gave such great hopes for the
propagation of the gospel among the Tartar tribes.&nbsp; He was
twenty-five years of age when he quitted his Lamasery, in 1837;
there he had passed fourteen years in the study of Lama books,
and had become well acquainted with Mongol and Mantchou
literature.&nbsp; He had as yet but a very superficial knowledge
of the Thibetian language.&nbsp; His tutor, an old Lama,
well-educated and much respected, not merely in the Lamasery, but
throughout the whole extent of the Yellowish Banner, had
cherished great hopes of his disciple; it was, therefore, very
reluctantly that he had consented to a temporary separation,
which he limited to a <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>month.&nbsp; Before his departure the
pupil prostrated himself, according to custom, at the feet of his
master, and begged him to consult for him the Book of
Oracles.&nbsp; After having turned over some leaves of a
Thibetian book, the old Lama addressed to him these words:
&ldquo;For fourteen years thou hast remained by thy
master&rsquo;s side like a faithful Chabi (disciple).&nbsp; Now,
for the first time, thou art about to go from me.&nbsp; The
future fills me with anxiety; be careful then to return at the
appointed time.&nbsp; If thy absence is prolonged beyond one moon
thy destiny condemns thee never more to set foot in our holy
Lamasery.&rdquo;&nbsp; The youthful pupil departed, resolved to
obey to the letter the instructions of his tutor.</p>
<p>When he arrived at our mission of Si-Wan, M. Gabet chose, as
the subject of his Mongol studies, an historical summary of the
Christian religion.&nbsp; The oral and written conferences lasted
nearly a month.&nbsp; The young Lama, subdued by the force of
truth, publicly abjured Buddhism, received the name of Paul, and
was ultimately baptized, after a long course of study.&nbsp; The
prediction of the old Lama had its perfect accomplishment; Paul,
since his conversion, has never again set foot in the Lamasery
which he quitted.</p>
<p>About 2,000 Lamas inhabit the Lamasery of Tchortchi, which, it
is said, is the favourite Lamasery of the Emperor, who has loaded
it with donations and privileges.&nbsp; The Lamas in charge of it
all receive a pension from the court of Peking.&nbsp; Those who
absent themselves from it by permission, and for reasons approved
by the superiors, continue to share in the distributions of money
and the provisions that are made during their absence; on their
return they duly receive the full amount of their share.&nbsp;
Doubtless that air of ease pervading the Lamasery of Tchortchi is
to be attributed to the imperial favours.&nbsp; The houses in it
are neat, sometimes even elegant; and you never see there, as in
other places, Lamas covered with dirty rags.&nbsp; The study of
the Mantchou language is much cultivated there, an incontestable
proof of the great devotion of the Lamasery to the reigning
dynasty.</p>
<p>With some rare exceptions the imperial benefactions go very
little way towards the construction of the Lamaseries.&nbsp;
Those grand and sumptuous monuments, so often met with in the
desert, are due to the free and spontaneous zeal of the
Mongols.&nbsp; So simple and economical in their dress and manner
of living, these people are generous, we might say, astonishingly
prodigal in all that concerns religious worship and
expenditure.&nbsp; When it is resolved to construct a Buddhist
temple, surrounded by its Lamasery, Lama collectors go on their
way forthwith, provided with passports, attesting the
authenticity of their mission.&nbsp; They disperse themselves
throughout the kingdom of Tartary, beg alms from tent to <!--

87</span>tent in the name of the Old Buddha.&nbsp; Upon entering
a tent and explaining the object of their journey, by showing the
sacred basin in which the offerings are placed, they are received
with joyful enthusiasm.&nbsp; There is no one but gives
something.&nbsp; The rich place in the &ldquo;badir&rdquo; ingots
of gold and silver; those who do not possess the precious metals,
offer oxen, horses, or camels.&nbsp; The poorest contribute
according to the extent of their means; they give lumps of
butter, furs, ropes made of the hair of camels and horses.&nbsp;
Thus, in a short time, are collected immense sums.&nbsp; Then, in
these deserts, apparently so poor, you see rise up, as if by
enchantment, edifices whose grandeur and wealth would defy the
resources of the richest potentates.&nbsp; It was, doubtless, in
the same manner, by the zealous co-operation of the faithful,
that were constructed in Europe those magnificent cathedrals
whose stupendous beauty is an abiding reproach to modern
selfishness and indifference.</p>

<p>The Lamaseries you see in Tartary are all constructed of brick
and stone.&nbsp; Only the poorest Lamas build for themselves
habitations of earth, and these are always so well whitewashed
that they closely resemble the rest.&nbsp; The temples are
generally built with considerable elegance, and with great
solidity; but these monuments always seem crushed, being too low
in proportion to their <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>dimensions.&nbsp; Around the Lamasery
rise, numerous and without order, towers or pyramids, slender and
tapering, resting generally on huge bases, little in harmony with
the tenuity of the constructions they support.&nbsp; It would be
difficult to say to what order of architecture the Buddhic
temples of Tartary belong.&nbsp; They are always fantastical
constructions of monstrous colonnades, peristyles with twisted
columns, and endless ascents.&nbsp; Opposite the great gate is a
kind of altar of wood or stone, usually in the form of a cone
reversed; on this the idols are placed, mostly seated
cross-legged.&nbsp; These idols are of colossal stature, but
their faces are fine and regular, except in the preposterous
length of the ears; they belong to the Caucasian type, and are
wholly distinct from the monstrous, diabolical physiognomies of
the Chinese Pou Ssa.</p>
<p>Before the great idol, and on the same level with it, is a
gilt seat where the living F&ocirc;, the Grand Lama of the
Lamasery is seated.&nbsp; All around the temple are long tables
almost level with the ground, a sort of ottomans covered with
carpet; and between each row there is a vacant space, so that the
Lamas may move about freely.</p>
<p>When the hour for prayer is come, a Lama, whose office it is
to summon the guests of the convent, proceeds to the great gate
of the temple, and blows, as loud as he can, a sea-conch,
successively towards the four cardinal points.&nbsp; Upon hearing
this powerful instrument, audible for a league round, the Lamas
put on the mantle and cap of ceremony and assemble in the great
inner court.&nbsp; When the time is come the sea-conch sounds
again, the great gate is opened, and the living F&ocirc; enters
the temple.&nbsp; As soon as he is seated upon the altar all the
Lamas lay their red boots at the vestibule, and advance barefoot
and in silence.&nbsp; As they pass him they worship the living
F&ocirc; by three prostrations, and then place themselves upon
the divan, each according to his dignity.&nbsp; They sit
cross-legged; always in a circle.</p>
<p>As soon as the master of the ceremonies has given the signal,
by tinkling a little bell, each murmurs in a low voice a
preliminary prayer, whilst he unrolls, upon his knees, the
prayers directed by the rubric.&nbsp; After this short
recitation, follows a moment of profound silence; the bell is
again rung, and then commences a psalm in double chorus, grave
and melodious.&nbsp; The Thibetian prayers, ordinarily in verse,
and written in a metrical and well-cadenced style, are
marvellously adapted for harmony.&nbsp; At certain pauses,
indicated by the rubric, the Lama musicians execute a piece of
music, little in concert with the melodious gravity of the
psalmody.&nbsp; It is a confused and deafening noise of bells,
cymbals, tambourines, sea-conchs&rsquo;, trumpets, pipes, etc.,
each musician playing on his <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>instrument
with a kind of ecstatic fury, trying with his brethren who shall
make the greatest noise.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The interior of the temple is usually filled with ornaments,
statues, and pictures, illustrating the life of Buddha, and the
various transmigrations of the more illustrious Lamas.&nbsp;
Vases in copper, shining like gold, of the size and form of
teacups, are placed in great numbers on a succession of steps, in
the form of an amphitheatre, before the idols.&nbsp; It is in
these vases that the people deposit their offerings of milk,
butter, Mongol wine, and meal.&nbsp; The extremities of each step
consist of censers, in which are ever burning aromatic plants,
gathered on the sacred mountains of Thibet.&nbsp; Rich silk
stuffs, covered with tinsel and gold embroidery, form, on the
heads of the idols, canopies from which hang pennants and
lanterns of painted paper or transparent horn.</p>
<p>The Lamas are the only artists who contribute to the ornament
<!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>and decoration of the temples.&nbsp; The paintings are
quite distinct from the taste and the principles of art as
understood in Europe.&nbsp; The fantastical and the grotesque
predominate inside and out, both in carvings and statuary, and
the personages represented, with the exception of Buddha, have
generally a monstrous and satanic aspect.&nbsp; The clothes seem
never to have been made for the persons upon whom they are
placed.&nbsp; The idea given is that of broken limbs concealed
beneath awkward garments.</p>
<p>Amongst these Lama paintings, however, you sometimes come
across specimens by no means destitute of beauty.&nbsp; One day,
during a visit in the kingdom of Gechekten to the great temple
called <i>Alton-Somn&eacute;</i> (Temple of Gold), we saw a
picture which struck us with astonishment.&nbsp; It was a large
piece representing, in the centre, Buddha seated on a rich
carpet.&nbsp; Around this figure, which was of life size, there
was a sort of glory, composed of miniatures, allegorically
expressing the Thousand Virtues of Buddha.&nbsp; We could
scarcely withdraw ourselves from this picture, remarkable as it
was, not only for the purity and grace of the design, but also
for the expression of the faces and the splendour of the
colouring.&nbsp; All the personages seemed full of life.&nbsp; We
asked an old Lama, who was attending us over the place, what he
knew about this admirable work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; said
he, raising his joined hands to his forehead in token of respect,
&ldquo;this picture is a treasure of the remotest antiquity; it
comprehends within its surface the whole doctrine of
Buddha.&nbsp; It is not a Mongol painting; it came from Thibet,
and was executed by a saint of the <i>Eternal
Sanctuary</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The artists here are, in general, more successful in the
landscapes than in the epic subjects.&nbsp; Flowers, birds,
trees, mythological animals, are represented with great truth and
with infinitely pleasing effect.&nbsp; The colouring is
wonderfully full of life and freshness.&nbsp; It is only a pity
that the painters of these landscapes have so very indifferent a
notion as to perspective and chiaro-oscuro.</p>
<p>The Lamas are far better sculptors than painters, and they are
accordingly very lavish of carvings in their Buddhist
temples.&nbsp; Everywhere in and about these edifices you see
works of this class of art, in quantity bespeaking the fecundity
of the artist&rsquo;s chisel, but of a quality which says little
for his taste.&nbsp; First, outside the temples are an infinite
number of tigers, lions, and elephants crouching upon blocks of
granite; then the stone balustrades of the steps leading to the
great gates are covered with fantastic sculptures representing
birds, reptiles, and beasts, of all kinds, real and
imaginary.&nbsp; Inside, the walls are decorated with relievos in
wood or stone, executed with great spirit and truth.</p>
<p>Though the Mongol Lamaseries cannot be compared, in point <!--
page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>either of extent or wealth, with those of Thibet, there
are some of them which are highly celebrated and greatly
venerated among the adorers of Buddha.</p>
<p>The most famous of all is that of the Great Kouren
(enclosure), in the country of the Khalkhas.&nbsp; As we had an
opportunity of visiting this edifice in one of our journeys into
Northern Tartary, we will here give some details respecting
it.&nbsp; It stands on the bank of the river Toula, at the
entrance to an immense forest, which extends thence northwards,
six or seven days&rsquo; journey to the confines of Russia, and
eastward, nearly five hundred miles to the land of the Solons, in
Mantchouria.&nbsp; On your way to the Great Kouren, over the
desert of Gobi, you have to traverse, for a whole month, an ocean
of sand, the mournful monotony of which is not relieved by a
single stream or a single shrub; but on reaching the Kougour
mountains, the western boundary of the states of the
Guison-Tamba, or King-Lama, the scene changes to picturesque and
fertile valleys, and verdant pasture-hills, crowned with forests
that seem as old as the world itself.&nbsp; Through the largest
valley flows the river Toula, which, rising in the Barka
mountains, runs from east to west through the pastures of the
Lamasery, and then entering Siberia, falls into Lake Baikal.</p>
<p>The Lamasery stands on the northern bank of the river, on the
slope of a mountain.&nbsp; The various temples inhabited by the
Guison-Tamba, and other Grand Lamas, are distinguishable from the
rest of the structure by their elevation and their gilded
roofs.&nbsp; Thirty thousand Lamas dwell in the Lamasery itself,
or in smaller Lamaseries erected about it.&nbsp; The plain
adjoining it is always covered with the tents of the pilgrims who
resort hither from all parts to worship Buddha.&nbsp; Here you
find the U-Pi-Ta-Dze, or &ldquo;Fish-skin Tartars,&rdquo;
encamped beside the Torgot Tartars from the summits of the sacred
mountains (Bokte-Oula), the Thibetians and the P&eacute;boum of
the Himalaya, with their long-haired oxen, mingling with the
Mantchous from the banks of the Songari and Amor.&nbsp; There is
an incessant movement of tents set up and taken down, and of
pilgrims coming and going on horses, camels, oxen, mules, or
waggons, and on foot.</p>
<p>Viewed from the distance, the white cells of the Lamas, built
in horizontal lines one above the other on the sides of the
mountain, seem the steps of a grand altar, of which the
tabernacle is the temple of the Guison-Tamba.&nbsp; In the depths
of that sanctuary, all resplendent with gold and bright
colouring, the Lama-King, The Holy, as he is called, <i>par
excellence</i>, receives the homage of the faithful, ever
prostrate, in succession, before him.&nbsp; There is not a
Khalkha Tartar who does not glory in the title of the <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span><i>Holy One&rsquo;s Disciple</i>.&nbsp; Wherever you
meet a man from the district of the Great Kouren, and ask him who
he is, his proud reply is always this: <i>Koure Bokte-Ain
Chabi</i>, (I am a disciple of the Holy Kouren.)</p>
<p>Half-a-league front the Lamasery, on the banks of the Toula,
is a commercial station of Chinese.&nbsp; Their wooden or mud
huts are fortified by a circle of high palisades to keep out the
pilgrims, who, despite their devotion, are extremely given to
thieving when ever the opportunity occurs.&nbsp; A watch and some
ingots of silver, stolen during the night from M. Gabet, left us
no doubt as to the want of probity in the Holy One&rsquo;s
disciples.</p>
<p>A good deal of trade is carried on here, Chinese and Russian
goods changing hands to a very large extent.&nbsp; The payments
of the former are invariably made in tea-bricks.&nbsp; Whether
the article sold be a house, a horse, a camel, or a bale of
goods, the price is settled for in bricks of tea.&nbsp; Five of
these represent, in value, an ounce of silver; the monetary
system, therefore, which Franklin so much disliked, is not in use
by these Northern Tartars.</p>
<p>The Court of Peking entertains several Mandarins at the Great
Kouren, ostensibly for the purpose of preserving order among the
Chinese traders, but in reality to keep a watch upon the
Guison-Tamba, always an object of suspicion to the Chinese
Emperors, who bear in mind that the famous Tching-Kis-Khan was a
Khalkha, and that the memory of his conquests has not passed away
from the hearts of this warlike people.&nbsp; The slightest
movement at the Great Kouren excites alarm at Peking.</p>
<p>In 1839 the Guison-Tamba announced his intention of paying a
visit to the Emperor Tao-Kouan.&nbsp; The Court of Peking became
horribly alarmed, and negotiators were dispatched to divert, if
possible, the Guison-Tamba from his journey; but all they could
effect was, that he should be attended by only 3,000 Lamas, and
that three other Khalkha sovereigns who were to have accompanied
him should be left behind.</p>
<p>Immediately upon the Guison-Tamba&rsquo;s departure on his
progress, all the tribes of Tartary put themselves in motion, and
took up positions on the road he was to travel, in vast
multitudes, each tribe bringing for his acceptance offerings of
horses, oxen, sheep, gold and silver bullion, and precious
stones.&nbsp; Wells were dug for him at intervals throughout the
length of the great desert of Gobi, and at each of these were
placed for his use, by the chieftain of the particular locality,
a store of provisions of all sorts.&nbsp; The Lama King was in a
yellow palanquin, carried by four horses, each led by a dignitary
of the Lamasery.&nbsp; The escort of 3,000 Lamas were before,
behind, and on each side of the palanquin, jovially dashing about
on horses and camels.&nbsp; The road almost throughout was <!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>lined with spectators, or rather with worshippers,
eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Holy, and upon his approach,
falling, first on their knees, and then on their faces, before
him, their hands crossed over the head.&nbsp; It seemed the
progress of a divinity come upon earth to bless its people.&nbsp;
On reaching the Great Wall, the Guison-Tamba, ceasing to be a
divinity, became only the chief of some nomad tribes, scorned by
the people of China, but feared by the Court of China, more alive
to political contingencies.&nbsp; Only one half of the 3,000
Lamas were permitted to attend their chief further, the rest
remaining encamped north of the Great Wall.</p>
<p>The Guison-Tamba sojourned at Peking for three months,
receiving an occasional visit from the Emperor; and from the
Grand Dignitaries.&nbsp; He then relieved the celestial city from
his troublesome presence, and after paying visits to the
Lamaseries of the Five Towers, and of the Blue Town, set out on
his return to his own states, when he died, the victim, it was
asserted, of a slow poison that had been administered to him by
order of the Emperor.&nbsp; The Khalkhas, however, were more
irritated than intimidated by his death, for they are persuaded
that their Guison-Tamba never actually dies.&nbsp; All he does,
when he appears to die, is to transmigrate to some other country,
whence he returns to them younger, more vigorous, more active
than ever.&nbsp; In 1844, accordingly, they were told that their
living Buddha was incarnate in Thibet, and they went thither, in
solemn procession, to fetch the child of five years old who was
indicated to them, and to place him on his imperishable
throne.&nbsp; While we were encamped at Kou-Kou-Noor, on the
banks of the Blue Sea, we saw pass by us the great caravan of
Khalkhas, who were on their way to Lha-Ssa to bring home the
Lama-King of the Great Kouren.</p>
<p>The Kouren of the Thousand Lamas&mdash;<i>Mingan Laman&eacute;
Kour&eacute;</i>&mdash;also a celebrated Lamasery, which dates
from the invasion of China by the Mantchous.&nbsp; When
Tchun-Tche, <a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a> founder of the dynasty now reigning in
China, descended from the forests of Mantchouria to march upon
Peking, he met on his way a Lama of Thibet, whom he consulted as
to the issue of his enterprise.&nbsp; The Lama promised him
complete success, whereupon Tchun-Tche ordered him to come and
see him when he should be installed at Peking.&nbsp; After the
Mantchous had rendered themselves masters of the capital of the
empire, the Lama did not fail to keep his appointment.&nbsp; The
Emperor at once recognised the person who had favoured him with
such an auspicious horoscope; and, in token of <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>his
gratitude, allotted to him a large extent of land whereon to
construct a Lamasery, and revenues sufficient for the support of
a thousand Lamas.&nbsp; From the time of its erection, however,
the Lamasery of the Thousand Lamas has grown and grown, so that
at present it contains more than four thousand Lamas, though its
original designation still remains.&nbsp; By degrees, traders
have established themselves around it, and have built a
considerable town, jointly occupied by Chinese and by
Tartars.&nbsp; The principal commerce of the place is in
beasts.</p>
<p>The Grand Lama of the Lamasery is, at the same time, sovereign
of the district.&nbsp; It is he who makes laws, who administers
justice, and who appoints magistrates.&nbsp; When he dies, his
subjects go and seek for him in Thibet, where he is always
understood to metempsychosise himself.</p>
<p>At the time of our visit to the Kouren of the Thousand Lamas,
everything was in utter confusion, by reason of a suit between
the Lama King and his four ministers, who are called, in the
Mongol language, Dchassak.&nbsp; The latter had taken upon
themselves to marry, and to build houses for themselves apart
from the Lamasery, things altogether subversive of Lama
discipline.&nbsp; The Grand Lama essayed to bring them to order;
the four Dchassak, instead of submitting, had collected a whole
heap of grievances, upon which they framed an accusation against
their chief before the Tou-Toun, the high Mantchou Mandarin, who
acts as Secretary-of-State for the Tartar department.</p>
<p>The suit had been under prosecution two months when we visited
the Lamasery, and we soon saw how the establishment was suffering
from the absence of its principals.&nbsp; Study or prayer there
was none; the great outer gate was open, and seemed not to have
been closed at all for some time past.&nbsp; We entered the
interior; all we found there was silence and solitude.&nbsp; The
grass was growing in the courts, and upon the walls.&nbsp; The
doors of the temples were padlocked, but through the gratings we
could see that the seats, the altars, the paintings, the statues,
were all covered with dust; everything manifested that the
Lamasery had been for some time in a state of utter
neglect.&nbsp; The absence of the superiors, and the uncertainty
as to the result of the suit, had unloosened all the bonds of
discipline.&nbsp; The Lamas had dispersed, and people began to
regard the very existence of the Lamasery as extremely
compromised.&nbsp; We have since heard that, thanks to enormous
bribery, the suit terminated in favour of the Lama King, and that
the four Dchassak were compelled to conform themselves in all
respects to the orders of their sovereign.</p>
<p>We may add to the enumeration of the many celebrated <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>Lamaseries, those of Blue Town, of Tolon-Noor, of
G&eacute;-Ho-Eul; and within the Great Wall, that of Peking, and
that of the Five Towers in Chan-Si.</p>
<p>After quitting the Lamasery of Tchortchi, just as we were
entering upon the Red Banner, we met a Mongol hunter, who was
carrying behind him, on his horse, a fine roebuck he had just
killed.&nbsp; We had been so long reduced to our insipid oatmeal,
seasoned with a few bits of mutton fat, that the sight of the
venison inspired us with a somewhat decided desire to vary our
entertainment; we felt, moreover, that our stomachs, weakened by
our daily privations, imperiously demanded a more substantial
alimentation.&nbsp; After saluting the hunter, therefore, we
asked him if he was disposed to sell his venison.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;when I placed myself
in ambush to await the deer, I had no thought of trading in my
head.&nbsp; The Chinese carmen, stationed up yonder beyond
Tchortchi, wanted to buy my game for four hundred sapeks, but I
said No!&nbsp; But to you, Sirs Lamas, I speak not as to Kitat;
there is my roebuck: give me what you please for it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We told Samdadchiemba to pay the hunter five hundred sapeks and
hanging the venison over the neck of one of the camels, we
proceeded on our way.</p>
<p>Five hundred sapeks are equivalent to about 2s. ld., and this
is the ordinary price of a roebuck in Tartary; the price of a
sheep is thrice that amount.&nbsp; Venison is little esteemed by
the Tartars, and still less by the Chinese; black meat, say they,
is never so good as white.&nbsp; Yet in the larger cities of
China, and especially at Peking, black meat has honourable place
on the tables of the rich and of the mandarins; a circumstance,
however, to be attributed to the scarcity of the article, and a
desire for variety.&nbsp; The Mantchous, indeed, do not come
within the preceding observation; for, great lovers of hunting,
they are also great lovers of its produce, and especially of
bears, stags, and pheasants.</p>
<p>It was just past noon when we came to a spot marvellously
beautiful.&nbsp; After passing through a narrow opening between
two rocks, whose summits seemed lost in the clouds, we found
ourselves in a large enclosure, surrounded by lofty hills, on
which grew a number of scattered pines.&nbsp; An abundant
fountain supplied a small stream, whose banks were covered with
angelica and wild mint.&nbsp; The rivulet, after making the
circuit of the enclosure, amid rich grass, had its issue thence
by an opening similar to that by which we had entered the
place.&nbsp; No sooner had a glance comprehended the attractions
of the spot, than Samdadchiemba moved that we should at once set
up our tent there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us go no further
to-day,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;let us encamp here.&nbsp; We have
not gone far this morning, it is true, and the sun is still very
high; but we have got the venison to prepare, and should
therefore encamp <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>earlier than usual.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
one opposing the honourable gentleman&rsquo;s motion, it was put
and carried unanimously, and we proceeded to set up our tent by
the side of the spring.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba had often talked of his great dexterity in the
dissection of animals, and he was delighted with this opportunity
of displaying his excellence in this respect.&nbsp; Having
suspended the roebuck from a pine-branch, sharpened his knife
upon a tent-pin, and turned up his sleeves to the elbow, he asked
whether we would have the animal dismembered <i>&agrave; la
Chinoise</i>, <i>&agrave; la Turque</i>, or <i>&agrave; la
Tartare</i>.&nbsp; Unprovided with any reason for preferring any
one of these modes to the other two, we left it to Samdadchiemba
to obey the impulse of his genius in the matter.&nbsp; In a
minute he had skinned and gutted the animal, and he then cut away
the flesh from the bones, in one piece, without separating the
limbs, so as to leave suspended from the tree merely the skeleton
of the deer.&nbsp; This, it appeared, was the Turkish fashion, in
use upon long journeys, in order to relieve travellers from the
useless burden of bones.</p>
<p>This operation completed, Samdadchiemba cut some slices of
venison and proceeded to fry them in mutton fat, a manner of
preparing venison not perhaps in strict accordance with the rules
of the culinary art; but the difficulty of the circumstances did
not allow us to do better.&nbsp; Our banquet was soon ready, but,
contrary to our expectations, we were not the first to taste it;
we had seated ourselves triangularly on the grass, having in the
midst the lid of the pot, which served us as a dish, when all of
a sudden we heard, as it were, the rushing of a storm over our
heads: a great eagle dashed, like a lightning stroke, upon our
entertainment, and immediately rose with equal rapidity, bearing
off in each claw a large slice of venison.&nbsp; Upon recovering
from our fright at this sudden incident, we ourselves were fain
to laugh at the ludicrous aspect of the matter, but Samdadchiemba
did not laugh by any means; be was in a paroxysm of fury, not
indeed at the loss of the venison, but because the eagle, in its
flight, had insolently dealt him a sound box on the ear with the
extremity of its great wings.</p>
<p>This event served to render us more cautious on the following
venison days.&nbsp; During our previous journeyings we had,
indeed, on several occasions observed eagles hovering over our
heads at meal-times, but no accident of this kind had occurred;
probably the royal birds had scorned our mere oatmeal
repasts.</p>
<p>You see the eagle almost everywhere throughout the deserts of
Tartary; sometimes hovering and making large circles in the air,
sometimes perched upon a rising ground, motionless as the hillock
itself.&nbsp; No one in these countries hunts the eagle or
molests it in any way; it may make its nest where it pleases, and
there bring <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>up its eaglets, and itself grow old,
without being in the smallest degree interfered with by
man.&nbsp; You often see before you an eagle resting on the
plain, and looking there larger than a sheep; as you approach,
before rising, it leisurely moves along the ground, beating its
wings, and then, by degrees ascending, it attains the altitude
where it can fly in all its grandeur and power.</p>
<p>After several days journey we quitted the country of the Eight
Banners and entered Western Toumet.&nbsp; At the time of the
conquest of China by the Mantchous, the king of Toumet, having
distinguished himself in the expedition as an auxiliary of the
invaders, the conqueror, in order to evince his gratitude for the
services which the prince had rendered him, gave him the fine
districts situated north of Peking, beyond the Great Wall.&nbsp;
From that period they have borne the name of Eastern Toumet, and
Old Toumet took that of Western Toumet; the two Toumets are
separated from each other by the Tchakar River.</p>
<p>The Mongol Tartars of Western Toumet do not lead the pastoral
and nomadic life; they cultivate their lands and apply themselves
to the arts of civilized nations.&nbsp; We had been for nearly a
month traversing the desert, setting-up our tent for the night in
the first convenient place we found, and accustomed to see
nothing but, above us the sky, and below and around us
interminable prairies.&nbsp; We had long, as it were, broken with
the world, for all we had seen of mankind had been a few Tartar
horsemen dashing across the Land of Grass, like so many birds of
passage.&nbsp; Without suspecting it, our tastes had insensibly
become modified, and the desert of Mongolia had created in us a
temperament friendly to the tranquillity of solitude.&nbsp; When,
therefore, we found ourselves amid the cultivation, the movement,
the bustle, the confusion of civilized existence, we felt, as it
were, oppressed, suffocated; we seemed gasping for breath, and as
though every moment we were going to be stifled.&nbsp; This
impression, however, was evanescent; and we soon got to think
that, after all, it was more comfortable and more agreeable,
after a day&rsquo;s march, to take up our abode in a warm,
well-stored inn, than to have to set up a tent, to collect fuel,
and to prepare our own very meagre repast, before we could take
our rest.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Western Toumet, as may well be imagined,
have completely lost the stamp of their original Mongol
character; they have all become, more or less, Chinese; many of
them do not even know a word of the Mongol language.&nbsp; Some,
indeed, do not scruple to express contempt for their brothers of
the desert, who refuse to subject their prairies to the
ploughshare; they say, how ridiculous is it for men to be always
vagabondizing about, and to have merely wretched tents wherein to
shelter their heads, when they might so easily build houses, and
obtain wealth and comforts of all kinds from the land beneath
their feet.&nbsp; And, indeed, the Western Toumetians are
perfectly right in preferring the occupation of agriculturist to
that of shepherd, for they have magnificent plains, well watered,
fertile, and favourable to the production of all kinds of grain
crops.&nbsp; When we passed through the country, harvest was
over; but the great stacks of corn that we saw in all directions
told us that the produce had been abundant and fine.&nbsp;
Everything throughout Western Toumet bears the impress of
affluence; nowhere, go in what direction you may, do you see the
wretched tumble-down houses that disfigure the highways and
by-ways of China; nowhere do you see the miserable, half-starved,
half-clothed creatures that pain the hearts of travellers in
every other country: all the peasants here are well fed, well
lodged, and well clothed.&nbsp; All the villages and roads are
beautified with groups and avenues of fine trees; whereas, in the
other Tartar regions, cultivated by the Chinese, no trees are to
be seen; trees are not even planted, for everybody knows they
would be pulled up next day by some miserable pauper or other,
for fuel.</p>
<p>We had made three days&rsquo; journey through the cultivated
lands of the Toumet, when we entered <i>Kou-Kou-Hote</i> (Blue
Town), called <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>in Chinese
<i>Koni-Hoa-Tchen</i>.&nbsp; There are two towns of the same
name, five <i>lis</i> distant from one another.&nbsp; The people
distinguish them by calling the one &ldquo;Old Town,&rdquo; and
the other &ldquo;New Town,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Commercial
Town,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Military Town.&rdquo;&nbsp; We first
entered the latter, which was built by the Emperor Khang-Hi, to
defend the empire against its northern enemies.&nbsp; The town
has a beautiful, noble appearance, which might be admired in
Europe itself.&nbsp; We refer, however, only to its circuit of
embattled walls, made of brick; for inside, the low houses, built
in the Chinese style, are little in unison with the lofty, huge
ramparts that surround them.&nbsp; The interior of the town
offers nothing remarkable but its regularity, and a large and
beautiful street, which runs through it from east to west.&nbsp;
A Kiang-Kian, or military commandant, resides here with 10,000
soldiers, who are drilled every day; so that the town may be
regarded as a garrison town.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the New Town of Koukou Khoton are Mantchou
Tartars; but if you did not previously know the fact, you would
scarcely suspect it from hearing them speak.&nbsp; Amongst them
there is perhaps not a single man who understands the language of
his own country.&nbsp; Already two ages have passed away since
the Mantchous made themselves masters of the vast empire of
China, and you would say that during these two centuries they
have been unceasingly working out their own annihilation.&nbsp;
Their manners, their language, their very country&mdash;all has
become Chinese.&nbsp; It may now be affirmed that Mantchou
nationality has become irremediably annihilated.&nbsp; In order
to account for this strange counter-revolution, and to understand
how the Chinese have been able to fuse their conquerors with
themselves, and to get possession of Mantchouria, we must look
some way back, and enter somewhat into detail.</p>
<p>In the time of the Ming dynasty, which flourished in China
from 1368 to 1644, the Mantchous, or Eastern Tartars, after a
long series of internal wars, concurred in the selection of a
chief, who united all the tribes into one, and established a
kingdom.&nbsp; From that time this ferocious and barbarian people
insensibly acquired an importance which gave great umbrage to the
Court of Peking; and in 1618 its power was so well established,
that its king did not fear to transmit to the Emperor of China
the statement of seven grievances which, he said, he had to
avenge.&nbsp; The daring manifesto finished with these words:
&ldquo;<i>And in order to avenge these seven injuries</i>, <i>I
will reduce and subjugate the dynasty of the
Ming</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly afterwards the empire was
convulsed with revolts in all directions; the rebel chief
besieged Peking, and took it.&nbsp; There-upon the Emperor,
despairing of his fortune, hanged himself from <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>a tree in
the Imperial garden, leaving near him these words, written in his
own blood: &ldquo;<i>Since the empire is falling</i>, <i>the
Emperor</i>, <i>too</i>, <i>must fall</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ou-San-Koue&iuml;, the Imperial general, called in the Mantchous
to aid him in reducing the rebels.&nbsp; The latter were put to
flight, and while the Chinese general was pursuing them
southward, the Tartar chief returned to Peking, and finding the
throne vacant, assumed it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Previous to this event, the Great Wall, carefully maintained
by the Ming dynasty, had kept the Mantchous from entering China,
while, reciprocally, the Chinese were forbidden to enter
Mantchouria.&nbsp; After the Mantchou conquest of the empire,
however, there was no longer any frontier separating the two
nations.&nbsp; The Great Wall was freely passed, and the
communication between the <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>two
countries once thrown open, the Chinese populations of Pe-Tchi-Li
and Chan-Toung, hitherto confined within their narrow provinces,
burst like torrents upon Mantchouria.&nbsp; The Tartar chief had
been considered the sole master, the sole possessor of the lands
of his kingdom; but, established as Emperor of China, he
distributed his vast possessions among the Mantchous, upon the
condition that they should pay him heavy rents for them every
year.&nbsp; By means of usury and cunning, and persevering
machinations, the Chinese have since rendered themselves masters
of all the lands of their conquerors, leaving to them merely
their empty titles, their onerous statutory labour, and the
payment of oppressive rents.&nbsp; The quality of Mantchou has
thus by degrees become a very costly affair, and many, of
consequence, seek altogether to abnegate it.&nbsp; According to
the law, there is, every third year, a census made of the
population of each banner, and all persons who do not cause their
names to be inscribed on the roll, are deemed no longer to belong
to the Mantchou nation; those, therefore, of the Mantchous whose
indigence induces them to desire exemption from statute labour
and military service, do not present themselves to the census
enumerators, and by that omission enter the ranks of the Chinese
people.&nbsp; Thus, while, on the one hand, constant migration
has carried beyond the Great Wall a great number of Chinese, on
the other, a great number of Mantchous have voluntarily abdicated
their nationality.</p>
<p>The decline, or rather the extinction of the Mantchou nation,
is now progressing more rapidly than ever.&nbsp; Up to the reign
of Tao-Kouan, the regions watered by the Songari were exclusively
inhabited by Mantchous: entrance into those vast districts was
prohibited to the Chinese, and no man was permitted to cultivate
the soil within their range.&nbsp; At the commencement of the
present reign, these districts were put up for public sale, in
order to supply the deficiency in the Imperial treasury.&nbsp;
The Chinese rushed upon them like birds of prey, and a few years
sufficed to remove every thing that could in any way recall the
memory of their ancient possessors.&nbsp; It would be vain for
anyone now to seek in Mantchouria a single town, a single
village, that is not composed entirely of Chinese.</p>
<p>Yet, amid the general transformation, there are still a few
tribes, such as the Si-Po and the Solon, which faithfully retain
the Mantchou type.&nbsp; Up to the present day their territories
have been invaded neither by the Chinese nor by cultivation; they
continue to dwell in tents and to furnish soldiers to the
Imperial armies.&nbsp; It has been remarked, however, that their
frequent appearance at Peking, and their long periods of service
in the provincial garrisons, are beginning to make terrible
inroads upon their habits and tastes.</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>When the Mantchous conquered China, they imposed upon
the conquered people a portion of their dress and many of their
usages.&nbsp; Tobacco smoking, for example, and the manner of
dressing the hair, now in use by the Chinese, came to them from
the Mantchou Tartars.&nbsp; But the Chinese, in their turn, did
far more than this; they managed to make their conquerors adopt
their manners and their language.&nbsp; You may now traverse
Mantchouria to the river Amour, without being at all aware that
you are not travelling in a province of China.&nbsp; The local
colouring has become totally effaced.&nbsp; With the exception of
a few nomadic tribes no one speaks Mantchou: and there would,
perhaps, remain no trace of this fine language, had not the
Emperors Khang-Hi and Kien-Loung erected, in its honour,
monuments imperishable in themselves, and which will ever attract
the attention of European orientalists.</p>
<p>At one time the Mantchous had no writing of their own; it was
not until 1624, that Tai-Tsou-Kao-Hoang-Ti, chief of the Eastern
Tartars, directed several learned persons of his nation to design
a system of letters for the Mantchous, upon the model of those of
the Mongols.&nbsp; Subsequently, in 1641, a man of great genius,
named Tahai, perfected the work, and gave to the Mantchou system
of letters the elegance, clearness, and refinement which now
characterize it.</p>
<p>Chun-Tche had the finest productions of Chinese literature
translated into Mantchou.&nbsp; Khang-Hi established an academy
of learned persons, equally versed in the Chinese and Tartar
languages, whom he employed upon the translation of classical and
historical works, and in the compilation of several
dictionaries.&nbsp; In order to express novel objects and the
various conceptions previously unknown to the Mantchous, it was
necessary to invent terms, borrowed, for the most part, from the
Chinese, and adapted, by slight alterations, as closely as
possible, to the Tartar idiom.&nbsp; This process, however,
tending to destroy, by imperceptible degrees, the originality of
the Mantchou language, the Emperor Kien-Loung, to avert the
danger, had a Mantchou dictionary compiled, from which all
Chinese words were excluded.&nbsp; The compilers went about
questioning old men and other Mantchous deemed most conversant
with their mother-tongue, and rewards were given to such as
brought forward an obsolescent word or expression which was
deemed worthy of revival and perpetuation in the dictionary.</p>
<p>Thanks to the solicitude and enlightened zeal of the first
sovereigns of the present dynasty, there is now no good Chinese
book which has not been translated into Mantchou; and all these
translations are invested with the greatest possible
authenticity, as having been executed by learned academies, by
order and under <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the immediate auspices of several
emperors: and as having, moreover, been subsequently revised and
corrected by other academies, equally learned, and whose members
were versed alike in the Chinese language and in the Mantchou
idiom.</p>
<p>The Mantchou language has attained, by means of all these
learned labours, a solid basis; it may, indeed, become no longer
spoken, but it will ever remain a classic tongue, and ever be of
most important aid to philologers applying their studies to the
Asiatic tongues.&nbsp; Besides numerous and faithful translations
of the best Chinese books, the Mantchou language possesses
versions of the principal productions in the Lamanesque,
Thibetian, and Mantchou literature.&nbsp; A few years labour will
thus suffice to place the diligent student of Mantchou in full
possession of all the most precious monuments of Eastern Asiatic
literature.</p>
<p>The Mantchou language is sonorous, harmonious, and, above all,
singularly clear.&nbsp; Its study is now rendered easy and
agreeable by H. Conon de la Gabelentz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elemens de
la Grammaire Mantchou,&rdquo; published at Altemburg, in Saxony,
and which develops, with happy lucidity, the mechanism and rules
of the language.&nbsp; The excellent work of this learned
orientalist cannot fail to be of great assistance to all who
desire to apply themselves to the study of a language menaced
with extinction in the very country which gave it birth, but
which France, at least, will preserve for the use of the world of
letters.&nbsp; M. Conon de la Gabelentz says, in the preface to
his grammar: &ldquo;I have selected the French language in the
preparation of my work, because France is, as yet, the only
European country in which Mantchou has been cultivated, so that
it seems to me indispensable that all who desire to study this
idiom should first know French, as being the tongue in which are
composed the only European works which relate to Mantchou
literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the French missionaries were enriching their country
with the literary treasures which they found in these remote
regions, they were, at the same time, ardently engaged in
diffusing the light of Christianity amid these idolatrous
nations, whose religion is merely a monstrous medley of doctrines
and practices borrowed at once from Lao-Tseu, Confucius, and
Buddha.</p>
<p>It is well known that in the earlier years of the present
dynasty, these missionaries had, by their talents, acquired great
influence at court; they always accompanied the Emperors in the
long and frequent journeys which at that period they were
accustomed to make into the regions of their ancient rule.&nbsp;
These zealous preachers of the gospel never failed on all such
occasions to avail themselves of the protection and influence
they enjoyed, as a means for sowing, <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>wherever
they went, the seeds of the true faith.&nbsp; Such was the first
origin of the introduction of Christianity into
Mantchouria.&nbsp; They reckoned at first but few neophytes; but
the number of these was insensibly augmented afterwards by the
migrations of the Chinese, in which were always to be found
several Christian families.&nbsp; These missions formed part of
the diocese of Peking until within a few years past; then the
Bishop of Nanking, administrator of the diocese of Peking,
finding himself nigh the close of his career, and fearing that
the political commotions of which Portugal, his native country,
was at that time the theatre, would preclude the Portuguese
church from sending an adequate number of labourers to cultivate
the vast field which had been confided to him, communicated his
apprehensions to the Sacred College de Propagand&acirc; Fide, and
earnestly entreated its members to take under their especial
attention a harvest, already ripe, but which was under peril of
destruction, for want of husbandmen to gather it in.&nbsp; The
sacred congregation, touched with the anxiety of this venerable
and zealous old man, among its other arrangements for meeting the
requirements of these unfortunate missions, dismembered
Mantchouria from the diocese of Peking, and erected it into an
Apostolic Vicariat, which was confided to the charge of the
Foreign Missionary Society.&nbsp; M. Verolles, Bishop of
Colombia, was made the new Vicar Apostolic.&nbsp; Nothing less
than the patience, the devotion, the every virtue of an apostle,
was essential for the due administration of this
Christendom.&nbsp; The prejudices of the neophytes, not as yet
brought within the rules of ecclesiastical discipline, were, for
M. Verolles, obstacles more difficult to overcome than even the
ruggedness of heart of the pagans; but his experience and his
wisdom soon triumphed over all impediments.&nbsp; The mission has
assumed a new form; the number of Christians is annually
augmenting; and there is now every hope that the Apostolic
Vicariat of Mantchouria will become one of the most flourishing
missions in Asia.</p>
<p>Mantchouria is bounded on the north by Siberia, on the south
by the Gulf Phou-Hai and Corea, on the east by the sea of Japan,
and on the west by Russian Dauria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Moukden, in Chinese Chen-Yan, is the chief town of
Mantchouria, and may be considered the second capital of the
Chinese empire.&nbsp; The Emperor has a palace and courts of
justice there on the model of those at Peking.&nbsp; Moukden is a
large and fine city, surrounded by thick and lofty ramparts; the
streets are broad and regular, and less dirty and tumultuous than
those of Peking.&nbsp; One entire quarter is appropriated to the
princes of the Yellow Girdle; that is, to the members of the
Imperial family.&nbsp; They are all under the direction of a
grand Mandarin, who is entrusted with <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the
inspection of their conduct, and empowered summarily to punish
any offences they may commit.</p>
<p>After Moukden, the most remarkable towns are Ghirin,
surrounded by high wooden palisades, and Ningouta, the native
place of the reigning Imperial family.&nbsp; Lao-yan, Kai-Tcheou,
and Kin-Tcheou, are remarkable for the extensive commerce their
maritime position brings them.</p>
<p>Mantchouria, watered by a great number of streams and rivers,
is a country naturally fertile.&nbsp; Since the cultivation has
been in the hands of the Chinese, the soil has been enriched by a
large number of the products of the interior.&nbsp; In the
southern part, they cultivate successfully the dry rice, or that
which has no need of watering, and the Imperial rice, discovered
by the Emperor Khang-Hi.&nbsp; These two sorts of rice would
certainly succeed in France.&nbsp; They have also abundant
harvests of millet, of Kao-L&eacute;ang or Indian corn (<i>Holcus
Sorghum</i>), from which they distil excellent brandy; sesamum,
linseed, hemp, and tobacco, the best in the whole Chinese
empire.</p>
<p>The Mantchourians pay especial attention to the cultivation of
the herbaceous-stemmed cotton plant, which produces cotton in
extraordinary abundance.&nbsp; A Meou of these plants, a space of
about fifteen square feet, ordinarily produces 2,000 lbs. of
cotton.&nbsp; The fruit of the cotton-tree grows in the form of a
cod or shell, and attains the size of a hazel-nut.&nbsp; As it
ripens, the cod opens, divides into three parts, and develops
three or four small tufts of cotton which contain the
seeds.&nbsp; In order to separate the seed, they make use of a
sort of little bow, firmly strung, the cord of which vibrating
over the cotton tufts removes the seeds, of which a portion is
retained for next year&rsquo;s sowing, and the rest is made into
oil, resembling linseed oil.&nbsp; The upper portion of
Mantchouria, too cold to grow cotton, has immense harvests of
corn.</p>
<p>Besides these productions, common to China, Mantchouria
possesses three treasures <a name="citation105"></a><a
href="#footnote105" class="citation">[105]</a> peculiar to
itself: jin-seng, sable fur, and the grass Oula.</p>
<p>The first of these productions has been long known in Europe,
though our learned Academy there ventured some years ago to doubt
its existence.&nbsp; Jin-seng is perhaps the most considerable
article of Mantchourian commerce.&nbsp; Throughout China there is
no chemist&rsquo;s shop unprovided with more or less of it.</p>
<p>The root of jin-seng is straight, spindle-shaped, and very
knotty; seldom so large as one&rsquo;s little finger, and in
length from two to three inches.&nbsp; When it has undergone its
fitting preparation, its colour <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>is a
transparent white, with sometimes a slight red or yellow
tinge.&nbsp; Its appearance, then, is that of a branch of
stalactite.</p>
<p>The Chinese report marvels of the jin-seng, and no doubt it
is, for Chinese organization, a tonic of very great effect for
old and weak persons; but its nature is too heating, the Chinese
physicians admit, for the European temperament, already, in their
opinion, too hot.&nbsp; The price is enormous, and doubtless its
dearness contributes, with a people like the Chinese, to raise
its celebrity so high.&nbsp; The rich and the Mandarins probably
use it only because it is above the reach of other people, and
out of pure ostentation.</p>
<p>The jin-seng, grown in Corea, and there called Kao-li-seng, is
of very inferior quality to that of Mantchouria.</p>
<p>The second special treasure of Eastern Tartary is the fur of
the sable, which, obtained by the hunters with immense labour and
danger, is of such excessive price that only the princes and
great dignitaries of the empire can purchase it.&nbsp; The grass
called Oula, the third specialty of Mantchouria, is, on the
contrary, of the commonest occurrence; its peculiar property is,
that if put into your shoes, it communicates to the feet a
soothing warmth, even in the depth of winter.</p>
<p>As we have said above, the Mantchou Tartars have almost wholly
abdicated their own manners, and adopted instead those of the
Chinese; yet, amid this transformation of their primitive
characters, they have still retained their old passion for
hunting, for horse exercise, and for archery.&nbsp; At all
periods of their history, they have attached an astonishing
importance to these various exercises; any one may convince
himself of this by merely running his eye over a Mantchou
dictionary.&nbsp; Every thing, every incident, every attribute
relating to these exercises, has its special expression, so as to
need no circumlocution to convey it.&nbsp; There are different
names, not only for the different colours of the horse, for
example, for its age and qualities, but for all its movements;
and it is just the same with reference to hunting and
archery.</p>
<p>The Mantchous are excellent archers, and among them the tribe
Solon are particularly eminent in this respect.&nbsp; At all the
military stations, trials of skill with the bow take place on
certain periodical occasions, in presence of the Mandarins and of
the assembled people.&nbsp; Three straw men, of the size of life,
are placed in a straight line, at from twenty to thirty paces
distance from one another; the archer is on a line with them,
about fifteen feet off from the first figure, his bow bent, and
his finger on the string.&nbsp; The signal being given, he puts
his horse to a gallop, and discharges his arrow at the first
figure; without checking his horse&rsquo;s speed, he takes a
second arrow from his quiver, places it in the bow, and <!-- page
107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>discharges it against the second figure, and so with
the third; all this while the horse is dashing at full speed
along the line of the figures, so that the rider has to keep
himself firm in the stirrups while he man&oelig;uvres with the
promptitude necessary to avoid the getting beyond his mark.&nbsp;
From the first figure to the second, the archer has bare time for
drawing his arrow, fixing, and discharging it, so that when he
shoots, he has generally to turn somewhat on his saddle; and as
to the third shot, he has to discharge it altogether in the old
Parthian fashion.&nbsp; Yet for a competitor to be deemed a good
archer, it is essential that he should fire an arrow into every
one of the three figures.&nbsp; &ldquo;To know how to shoot an
arrow,&rdquo; writes a Mantchou author, &ldquo;is the first and
most important knowledge for a Tartar to acquire.&nbsp; Though
success therein seems an easy matter, success is of rare
occurrence.&nbsp; How many are there who practise day and
night?&nbsp; How many are there who sleep with the bow in their
arms? and yet how few are there who have rendered themselves
famous.&nbsp; How few are there whose names are proclaimed at the
matches!&nbsp; Keep your frame straight and firm; avoid vicious
postures; let your shoulders be immovable.&nbsp; Fire every arrow
into its mark, and you may be satisfied with your
skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day after our arrival at the military town of
Koukou-Khoton, we repaired on a visit to the mercantile
district.&nbsp; Our hearts were painfully affected at finding
ourselves in a Mantchou town, and hearing any language spoken
there but the Mantchou.&nbsp; We could not reconcile to our minds
the idea of a nation renegade of its nationality, of a conquering
people, in nothing distinguishable from the conquered, except,
perhaps, that they have a little less industry and a little more
conceit.&nbsp; When the Thibetian Lama promised to the Tartar
chief the conquest of China, and predicted to him that he should
soon be seated on the throne at Peking, he would have told him
more of truth, had he told him that his whole nation, its
manners, its language, its country, was about to be engulfed for
ever in the Chinese empire.&nbsp; Let any revolution remove the
present dynasty, and the Mantchou will be compelled to complete
fusion with the empire.&nbsp; Admission to their own country,
occupied entirely by Chinese, will be forbidden to them.&nbsp; In
reference to a map of Mantchouria, compiled by the Fathers
Jesuits, upon the order of the Emperor Khang-Hi, Father Duhalde
says that they abstained from giving the Chinese names of places
in the map; and he assigns for this the following reason:
&ldquo;Of what use would it be to a traveller through Mantchouria
to be told, for example, that the river Sakhalien-Oula is called
by the Chinese H&eacute;-Loung-Kiang, since it is not with
Chinese he has there to do; and the <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Tartars,
whose aid he requires, have never heard the Chinese
name.&rdquo;&nbsp; This observation might be just enough in the
time of Khang-Hi, but now the precise converse would hold good;
for in traversing Mantchouria it is always with Chinese you have
to deal, and it is always of the H&eacute;-Loung-Kiang that you
hear, and never of the Sakhalien-Oula.</p>

Lama&mdash;Departure from the Blue Town.</p>
<p>From the Mantchou town to the Old Blue Town is not more than
half an hour&rsquo;s walk, along a broad road, constructed
through the large market, which narrowed the town.&nbsp; With the
exception of the Lamaseries, which rise above the other
buildings, you see before you merely an immense mass of houses
and shops huddled confusedly together, without any order or
arrangement whatever.&nbsp; The ramparts of the old town still
exist in all their integrity; but the increase of the population
has compelled the people by degrees to pass this barrier.&nbsp;
Houses have risen outside the walls one after another until large
suburbs have been formed, and now the extra-mural city is larger
than the intra-mural.</p>
<p>We entered the city by a broad street, which exhibited nothing
remarkable except the large Lamasery, called, in common with the
<!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>more celebrated establishment in the province of
Chan-Si, the Lamasery of the Five Towers.&nbsp; It derives this
appellation from a handsome square tower with five turrets, one,
very lofty, in the centre and one at each angle.</p>
<p>Just beyond this the broad street terminated, and there was no
exit but a narrow lane running right and left.&nbsp; We turned
down what seemed the least dirty of these, but soon found
ourselves in a liquid slough of mud and filth, black, and of
suffocating stench&mdash;we had got into the Street of the
Tanners.&nbsp; We advanced slowly and shudderingly, for beneath
the mire lay hid, now a great stone, over which we stumbled, now
a hole, into which we sank.&nbsp; To complete our misfortune, we
all at once heard before us deafening cries and shouts,
indicating that along the tortuosities of the lane in which we
were horsemen and carts were about to meet us.&nbsp; To draw
back, or to stand aside, were equally impossible, so that our
only resource was to bawl on our own account, and, advancing,
take our chance.&nbsp; At the next turning we met the cavalcade,
and something extremely disagreeable seemed threatening us, when,
upon sight of our camels, the horses of the other party took
fright, and, turning right round, galloped off in utter
confusion, leaving the way clear before us.&nbsp; Thus, thanks to
our beasts of burden, we were enabled to continue our journey
without giving the way to any one, and we at last arrived,
without any serious accident, in a spacious street, adorned on
each side with fine shops.</p>
<p>We looked about for an inn, but fruitlessly; we saw several
inns, indeed, but these were not of the kind we sought.&nbsp; In
the great towns of Northern China and Tartary each inn is devoted
to a particular class of travellers, and will receive no
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Corndealers&rsquo; Arms&rdquo; inn, for
example, will not admit a horse dealer, and so on.&nbsp; The inns
which devote themselves to the entertainment of mere travellers
are called the taverns of the Transitory Guests.&nbsp; We were
pausing, anxiously looking about for one of these, when a young
man, hastening from an adjacent shop, came up to us: &ldquo;You
seek an inn, gentlemen travellers,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;suffer
me to guide you to one; yet I scarcely know one in the Blue City
worthy of you.&nbsp; Men are innumerable here, my Lords Lamas; a
few good, but, alas! most bad.&nbsp; I speak it from my
heart.&nbsp; In the Blue City you would with difficulty find one
man who is guided by his conscience; yet conscience is a
treasure!&nbsp; You Tartars, you, indeed, know well what
conscience is.&nbsp; Ah! I know the Tartars well! excellent
people, right-hearted souls!&nbsp; We Chinese are altogether
different&mdash;rascals, rogues.&nbsp; Not one Chinaman in ten
thousand heeds conscience.&nbsp; Here, in this Blue City,
everybody, with the merest exceptions, makes it his business to
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>cheat the worthy Tartars, and rob them of their
goods.&nbsp; Oh! it&rsquo;s shameful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the excellent creature threw up his eyes as he denounced
the knavery of his townsmen.&nbsp; We saw very clearly, however,
that the direction taken by the eyes thus thrown up was the
camel&rsquo;s back, whereon were two large cases, which our
disinterested adviser no doubt took to contain precious
merchandise.&nbsp; However, we let him lead us on and chatter as
he pleased.&nbsp; When we had been wandering about under his
escort for a full hour, and yet had reached no inn, we said to
him: &ldquo;We cannot think of troubling you further, since you
yourself seem not to know where we may find that which we
need.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be perfectly easy, my lords,&rdquo;
replied he; &ldquo;I am guiding you to an excellent, a
superexcellent hotel.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mention a word as to
troubling me; you pain me by the idea.&nbsp; What! are we not all
brothers?&nbsp; Away with the distinction between Tartar and
Chinese!&nbsp; True, the language is not the same, nor the dress;
but men have but one heart, one conscience, one invariable rule
of justice.&nbsp; Just wait one moment for me, my lords; I will
be with you again before you can look round,&rdquo; and so saying
he dived into a shop on the left.&nbsp; He was soon back with us,
making a thousand apologies for having detained us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must be very tired, my lords; one cannot be otherwise
when one is travelling.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis quite different from
being with one&rsquo;s own family.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he spoke, we
were accosted by another Chinese, a ludicrous contrast with our
first friend, whose round shining smiling face was perfectly
intense in its aspect of benevolence.&nbsp; The other fellow was
meagre and lanky, with thin, pinched lips and little black eyes,
half buried in the head, that gave to the whole physiognomy a
character of the most thorough knavery.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lords
Lamas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I see you have just arrived!&nbsp;
Excellent! And you have journeyed safely.&nbsp; Well, well!&nbsp;
Your camels are magnificent; &rsquo;tis no wonder you travel fast
and securely upon such animals.&nbsp; Well, you have arrived:
that&rsquo;s a great happiness.&nbsp; Se-Eul,&rdquo; he
continued, addressing the Chinese who had first got hold of us,
&ldquo;you are guiding these noble Tartars to an hotel.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis well!&nbsp; Take care that the hotel is a good one,
worthy of the distinguished strangers.&nbsp; What think you of
the &lsquo;Tavern of Eternal Equity?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The very hotel whither I was leading the Lords
Lamas.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is none better in the
empire.&nbsp; By the way, the host is an acquaintance of
mine.&nbsp; I cannot do better than accompany you and recommend
these noble Tartars to his best care.&nbsp; In fact, if I were
not to go with you, I should have a weight upon my heart.&nbsp;
When we are fortunate enough to meet brothers who need our aid,
how can we do too much for them, for we are all brothers!&nbsp;
My lords, you see <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>this young man and myself; well, we
two are clerks in the same establishment, and we make it our
pride to serve our brothers the Tartars; for, alas! in this
dreadful city there is but too little virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any one, hearing their professions of devoted zeal, would have
imagined these two personages to have been the friends of our
childhood; but we were sufficiently acquainted with Chinese
manners to perceive at once that we were the mark of a couple of
swindlers.&nbsp; Accordingly, when we saw inscribed on a door,
&ldquo;Hotel of the Three Perfections; transitory guests on horse
and camel entertained, and their affairs transacted with
infallible success,&rdquo; we at once directed our course up the
gateway, despite the vehement remonstrances of our worthy guides,
and rode down a long avenue to the great square court of the
hotel.&nbsp; The little blue cap worn by the attendants indicated
that we were in a Turkish establishment.</p>
<p>This proceeding of ours was not at all what the two Chinese
desired; but they still followed us, and, without appearing
disconcerted, continued to act their parts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
are the people of the hotel,&rdquo; cried they, with an immense
air; &ldquo;let them prepare a large apartment, a fine, clean
apartment?&nbsp; Their Excellencies have arrived, and must be
suitably accommodated.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the principal waiters
presented himself, holding by his teeth a key, in one hand a
broom, and in the other a watering-pot.&nbsp; Our two protectors
immediately took possession of these articles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave
everything to us,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;it is we who claim the
honour of personally waiting upon our illustrious friends; you,
attendants of the hotel, you only do things by halves, actuated
as you are merely by mercenary considerations.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thereupon they set to work sprinkling, sweeping, and cleaning the
room to which the waiter guided us.&nbsp; When this operation was
concluded, we seated ourselves on the khang; the two Chinese
&ldquo;knew themselves better than to sit by the side of our
Eminent Distinctions,&rdquo; and they accordingly squatted on the
floor.&nbsp; As tea was being served, a young man, well attired
and of exceedingly elegant address, came into the room, carrying
by the four corners a silk handkerchief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen
Lamas,&rdquo; said the elder of our previous companions,
&ldquo;this young man is the son of our principal, and doubtless
has been sent by his father to inquire after your health, and
whether you have so far journeyed in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
young man placed his handkerchief upon the table that stood
before us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here are some cakes my father has sent to
be eaten with your tea.&nbsp; When you have finished that meal,
he entreats you will come and partake of an humble repast in our
poor dwelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But why wear your <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>hearts out thus for us mere strangers?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed all three in chorus, &ldquo;the words
you utter cover us with blushes!&nbsp; What! can we do anything
in excess for brothers who have thus honoured us with their
presence in our poor city!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor
Tartars!&rdquo; said I in French to my colleague, &ldquo;how
thoroughly eaten up they must be when they fall into such hands
as these!&rdquo;&nbsp; These words, in an unknown tongue, excited
considerable surprise in our worthy friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
which of the illustrious kingdoms of Tartary dwell your
Excellencies?&rdquo; asked one of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not
Tartars at all,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! we saw
that at once; the Tartars have no such majesty of aspect as
yours; their mien has no grandeur about it!&nbsp; May we ask what
is the noble country whence you come?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
from the West; our native land is far hence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; replied the eldest of the three
knaves.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew it, and I said so to these young men,
but they are ignorant; they know nothing about physiognomy.&nbsp;
Ah! you are from the West.&nbsp; I know your country well; I have
been there more than once.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are delighted
to hear this: doubtless, then, you are acquainted with our
language?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I cannot say I know it
thoroughly; but there are some few words I understand.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t speak them, indeed; but that does not matter.&nbsp;
You western people are so clever, you know everything, the
Chinese language, the Tartarian, the western&mdash;you can speak
them all.&nbsp; I have always been closely mixed up with your
countrymen, and have invariably been selected to manage their
affairs for them whenever they come to the Blue Town.&nbsp; It is
always I who make their purchases for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had by this time finished our tea; our three friends rose,
and with a simultaneous bow, invited us to accompany them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My lords, the repast is by this time prepared, and our
chief awaits you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said we,
gravely, &ldquo;while we utter words full of reason.&nbsp; You
have taken the trouble to guide us to an inn, which shows you to
be men of warm hearts; you have here swept for us and prepared
our room; again, in proof of your excellent dispositions, your
master has sent us pastry, which manifests in him a benevolence
incapable of exhaustion towards the wayfaring stranger.&nbsp; You
now invite us to go and dine with you: we cannot possibly
trespass so grossly upon your kindness.&nbsp; No, dear friends,
you must excuse us; if we desire to make some purchases in your
establishment, you may rely upon us.&nbsp; For the present we
will not detain you.&nbsp; We are going to dine at the Turkish
Eating House.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, we rose and ushered our
excellent friends to the door.</p>
<p>The commercial intercourse between the Tartars and the Chinese
is revoltingly iniquitous on the part of the latter.&nbsp; So
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>soon as Mongols, simple, ingenuous men, if such there
be at all in the world, arrive in a trading town, they are
snapped up by some Chinese, who carry them off, as it were, by
main force, to their houses, give them tea for themselves and
forage for their animals, and cajole them in every conceivable
way.&nbsp; The Mongols, themselves without guile and incapable of
conceiving guile in others, take all they hear to be perfectly
genuine, and congratulate themselves, conscious as they are of
their inaptitude for business, upon their good fortune in thus
meeting with brothers, <i>Ahatou</i>, as they say, in whom they
can place full confidence, and who will undertake to manage their
whole business for them.&nbsp; A good dinner provided gratis in
the back shop, completes the illusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;If these
people wanted to rob me,&rdquo; says the Tartar to himself,
&ldquo;they would not go to all this expense in giving me a
dinner for nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; When once the Chinese has got
hold of the Tartar, he employs over him all the resources of the
skilful and utterly unprincipled knavery of the Chinese
character.&nbsp; He keeps him in his house, eating, drinking, and
smoking, one day after another, until his subordinates have sold
all the poor man&rsquo;s cattle, or whatever else he has to sell,
and bought for him, in return, the commodities he requires, at
prices double and triple the market value.&nbsp; But so plausible
is the Chinese, and so simple is the Tartar, that the latter
invariably departs with the most entire conviction of the immense
philanthropy of the former, and with a promise to return, when he
has other goods to sell, to the establishment where he has been
treated so fraternally.</p>
<p>The next morning we went out to purchase some winter clothing,
the want of which began to make itself sensibly felt.&nbsp; But
first, in order to facilitate our dealings, we had to sell some
ounces of silver.&nbsp; The money of the Chinese consists
entirely of small round copper coins, of the size of our
halfpenny, with a square hole in the centre, through which the
people string them, so that they may be more conveniently
carried.&nbsp; These coins the Chinese call, tsien; the Tartars,
dehos; and the Europeans, sapeks.&nbsp; Gold and silver are not
coined at all; they are melted into ingots of various sizes, and
thus put into circulation.&nbsp; Gold-dust and gold leaf are also
current in commerce, and they also possess bank notes.&nbsp; The
ordinary value of the ounce of silver is 1,700 or 1,800 sapeks,
according to the scarcity or abundance of silver in the
country.</p>
<p>The money changers have two irregular modes of making a profit
by their traffic: if they state the fair price of silver to the
customer, they cheat him in the weight; if their scales and their
method of weighing are accurate, they diminish the price of the
silver accordingly.&nbsp; But when they have to do with Tartars,
they employ neither <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>of these methods of fraud; on the
contrary, they weigh the silver scrupulously, and sometimes allow
a little overweight, and even they pay them above the market
price; in fact, they appear to be quite losers by the
transaction, and so they would be, if the weight and the price of
the silver alone were considered; their advantage is derived, in
these cases, from their manner of calculating the amount.&nbsp;
When they come to reduce the silver into sapeks, they do indeed
reduce it, making the most flagrant miscalculations, which the
Tartars, who can count nothing beyond their beads, are quite
incapable of detecting, and which they, accordingly, adopt
implicitly, and even with satisfaction, always considering they
have sold their bullion well, since they know the full weight has
been allowed, and that the full market price has been given.</p>
<p>At the money changers in the Blue Town, to which we went to
sell some silver, the Chinese dealers essayed, according to
custom, to apply this fraud to us, but they were
disconcerted.&nbsp; The weight shown by their scales was
perfectly correct, and the price they offered us was rather above
the ordinary course of exchange, and the bargain between us was
so far concluded.&nbsp; The chief clerk took the souan-pan, the
calculation table used by the Chinese, and after calculating with
an appearance of intense nicety, announced the result of his
operation.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is an exchange-office,&rdquo; said
we; &ldquo;you are the buyers, we the sellers; you have made your
calculation, we will make ours: give us a pencil and a piece of
paper.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing can be more just; you have
enunciated a fundamental law of commerce,&rdquo; and so saying,
they handed us a writing-case.&nbsp; We took the pencil, and a
very short calculation exhibited a difference in our favour of a
thousand sapeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Superintendent of the bank,&rdquo;
said we, &ldquo;your souan-pan is in error by a thousand
sapeks.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Impossible!&nbsp; Do you think that
all of a sudden I&rsquo;ve forgotten my souan-pan?&nbsp; Let me
go over it again;&rdquo; and he proceeded with an air of great
anxiety to appear correct, to set his calculating machine once
more in operation, the other customers by our side looking on
with great amazement at all this.&nbsp; When he had done:
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I knew I was right; see,
brother;&rdquo; and he passed the machine to a colleague behind
the counter, who went over his calculation; the result of their
operations was exactly the same to a fraction.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see,&rdquo; said the principal, &ldquo;there is no error.&nbsp;
How is it that our calculation does not agree with that which you
have written down there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is unimportant to
inquire why your calculation does not agree with ours; this is
certain, that your calculation is wrong and ours right.&nbsp; You
see these little characters that we have traced on this paper;
they are a very different thing from your souan-pan; it is
impossible for them to be <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>wrong.&nbsp; Were all the calculators in the world to
work the whole of their lives upon this operation, they could
arrive at no other result than this; that your statement is wrong
by a thousand sapeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The money-changers were extremely embarrassed, and began to
turn very red, when a bystander, who perceived that the affair
was assuming an awkward aspect, presented himself as
umpire.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll reckon it up for you,&rdquo; said
he, and taking the souan-pan, his calculation agreed with
ours.&nbsp; The superintendent of the bank hereupon made us a
profound bow: &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your
mathematics are better than mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, not at
all,&rdquo; replied we, with a bow equally profound; &ldquo;your
souan-pan is excellent, but who ever heard of a calculator always
exempt from error?&nbsp; People like you may very well be
mistaken once and a way, whereas poor simple folks like us make
blunders ten thousand times.&nbsp; Now, however, we have
fortunately concurred in our reckoning, thanks to the pains you
have taken.&rdquo;&nbsp; These phrases were rigorously required
under the circumstances, by Chinese politeness.&nbsp; Whenever
any person in China is compromised by any awkward incident, those
present always carefully refrain from any observation which may
make him blush, or as the Chinese phrase it, take away his
face.</p>
<p>After our conciliatory address had restored self-possession to
all present, everybody drew round the piece of paper on which we
had cast up our sum in Arabic numerals.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is a
fine souan-pan,&rdquo; said one to another; &ldquo;simple, sure,
and speedy.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; asked the
principal, &ldquo;what do these characters mean?&nbsp; What
souan-pan is this?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This souan-pan is
infallible,&rdquo; returned we; &ldquo;the characters are those
which the Mandarins of Celestial Literature use in calculating
eclipses, and the course of the seasons.&rdquo; <a
name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a>&nbsp; After a brief conversation on
the merits of the Arabic numerals, the cashier handed us the full
amount of sapeks, and we parted good friends.</p>
<p>The Chinese are sometimes victims to their own knavery, and we
have known even Tartars catch them in a snare.&nbsp; One day a
Mongol presented himself at the counter of a Chinese
moneychanger, with a youen-pao carefully packed and sealed.&nbsp;
A youen-pao is an ingot of silver weighing three pounds&mdash;in
China there are sixteen ounces to the pound; the three pounds are
never very rigorously exacted; there being generally four or five
ounces over, so that the usual weight of an ingot of silver is
fifty-two ounces.&nbsp; The Tartar had no sooner unpacked his
youen-pao than the Chinese clerk resolved to defraud him of an
ounce or two, and weighing it, he pronounced it to be fifty
ounces.&nbsp; &ldquo;My youen-pao weighs <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>fifty-two
ounces,&rdquo; exclaimed the Tartar.&nbsp; &ldquo;I weighed it
before I left home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, your Tartar scales
are all very well for sheep; but they don&rsquo;t do for weighing
bullion.&rdquo;&nbsp; After much haggling, the bargain was
concluded, the youen-pao was purchased as weighing fifty ounces,
and the Tartar, having first required and obtained a certificate
of the stated weight and value of the ingot, returned to his tent
with a good provision of sapeks and bank notes.</p>
<p>In the evening the principal of the establishment received the
usual report from each clerk of the business done in the course
of the day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said one of them with a
triumphant air, &ldquo;bought a youen-pao of silver, and made two
ounces by it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He produced the ingot, which the chief
received with a smile, soon changing into a frown.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What have you got here?&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is not silver!&rdquo;&nbsp; The ingot was handed round, and all
the clerks saw that indeed it was base bullion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know the Tartar,&rdquo; said the clerk who had purchased it,
&ldquo;and will have him up before the Mandarin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The satellites of justice were forthwith dispatched after the
roguish Tartar, whose offence, proved against him, was matter of
capital punishment.&nbsp; It was obvious that the ingot was base
bullion, and on the face of the affair there was clear proof that
the Tartar had sold it.&nbsp; The Tartar, however, stoutly
repudiated the imputation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The humblest of the
humble,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;craves that he may be allowed to
put forth a word in his defence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said the Mandarin, &ldquo;but beware how you
say aught other than the exact truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
true,&rdquo; proceeded the Tartar, &ldquo;that I sold a youen-pao
at this person&rsquo;s shop, but it was all pure silver.&nbsp; I
am a Tartar, a poor, simple man, and these people, seeking to
take advantage of me, have substituted a false for my genuine
ingot.&nbsp; I cannot command many words, but I pray our father
and mother, (<i>i.e.</i> the Mandarin), to have this false
youen-pao weighed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ingot was weighed, and was
found to contain fifty-two ounces.&nbsp; The Tartar now drew from
one of his boots a small parcel, containing, wrapped in rags, a
piece of paper, which he held up to the Mandarin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here is a certificate&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;which I
received at the shop, and which attests the value and weight of
the youen-pao that I sold.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mandarin looked over
the paper with a roguish smile, and then said: &ldquo;According
to the testimony of the clerk himself who wrote this certificate,
this Mongol sold to him a youen-pao weighing fifty ounces; this
youen-pao of base bullion weighs fifty-two ounces; this,
therefore, cannot be the Mongol&rsquo;s youen-pao; but now comes
the question, whose is it?&nbsp; Who are really the persons that
have false bullion in their possession?&rdquo;&nbsp; Every body
present, the Mandarin included, knew perfectly well how the case
stood; but the Chinese magistrate, tickled with the
Tartar&rsquo;s ingenuity, gave <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>him the
benefit of the clerk&rsquo;s dull roguery, and dismissed the
charge; but not so the accusers, who were well bastinadoed, and
would have been put to death as coiners, had they not found means
to appease justice by the present of some ingots of purer
metal.&nbsp; It is only, however, upon very rare and
extraordinary occasions that the Mongols get the better of the
Chinese.&nbsp; In the ordinary course of things, they are
everywhere, and always, and in every way, the dupes of their
neighbours who by dint of cunning and unprincipled machinations,
reduce them to poverty.</p>
<p>Upon receiving our sapeks, we proceeded to buy the winter
clothing we needed.&nbsp; Upon a consideration of the meagreness
of our exchequer, we came to the resolution that it would be
better to purchase what we required at some secondhand
shop.&nbsp; In China and Tartary no one has the smallest
repugnance to wear other people&rsquo;s clothes; he who has not
himself the attire wherein to pay a visit or make a holiday, goes
without ceremony to a neighbour and borrows a hat, or a pair of
trousers, or boots, or shoes, or whatever else he wants, and
nobody is at all surprised at these borrowings, which are quite a
custom.&nbsp; The only hesitation any one has in lending his
clothes to a neighbour, is, lest the borrower should sell them in
payment of some debt, or, after using them, pawn them.&nbsp;
People who buy clothes buy them indifferently, new or
secondhand.&nbsp; The question of price is alone taken into
consideration, for there is no more delicacy felt about putting
on another man&rsquo;s hat or trousers, than there is about
living in a house that some one else has occupied before you.</p>
<p>This custom of wearing other people&rsquo;s things was by no
means to our taste, and all the less so, that, ever since our
arrival at the mission of Si-Wang, we had not been under the
necessity of departing from our old habits in this respect.&nbsp;
Now, however, the slenderness of our purse compelled us to waive
our repugnance.&nbsp; We went out, therefore, in search of a
secondhand clothes shop, of which, in every town here, there are
a greater or less number, for the most part in connection with
pawnshops, called in these countries Tang-Pou.&nbsp; Those who
borrow upon pledges, are seldom able to redeem the articles they
have deposited, which they accordingly leave to die, as the
Tartars and Chinese express it; or in other words, they allow the
period of redemption to pass, and the articles pass altogether
from them.&nbsp; The old clothes shops of the Blue Town were
filled in this way with Tartar spoils, so that we had the
opportunity of selecting exactly the sort of things we required,
to suit the new costume we had adopted.</p>
<p>At the first shop we visited they showed us a quantity of
wretched garments turned up with sheep-skin; but though these
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>rags were exceedingly old, and so covered with grease
that it was impossible to guess at their original colour, the
price asked for them was exorbitant.&nbsp; After a protracted
haggling, we found it impossible to come to terms, and we gave up
this first attempt; and we gave it up, be it added, with a
certain degree of satisfaction, for our self-respect was somewhat
wounded at finding ourselves reduced even to the proposition of
wearing such filthy rags.&nbsp; We visited another shop, and
another, a third, and a fourth, and still several more.&nbsp; We
were shown magnificent garments, handsome garments, fair
garments, endurable garments, but the consideration of expense
was, in each instance, an impracticable stumbling-block.&nbsp;
The journey we had undertaken might endure for several years, and
extreme economy, at all events in the outset, was
indispensable.&nbsp; After going about the whole day, after
making the acquaintance of all the rag-merchants in the Blue
Town, after turning over and over all their old clothes, we were
fain to return to the secondhand dealer whom we had first
visited, and to make the best bargain we could with him.&nbsp; We
purchased from him, at last, two ancient robes of sheepskin,
covered with some material, the nature of which it was impossible
to identify, and the original colour of which we suspected to
have been yellow.&nbsp; We proceeded to try them on, and it was
at once evident that the tailor in making them had by no means
had us in his eye.&nbsp; M. Gabet&rsquo;s robe was too short, M.
Huc&rsquo;s too long; but a friendly exchange was impracticable,
the difference in height between the two missionaries being
altogether too disproportionate.&nbsp; We at first thought of
cutting the excess from the one, in order to make up the
deficiency of the other; but then we should have had to call in
the aid of a tailor, and this would have involved another drain
upon our purse; the pecuniary consideration decided the question,
and we determined to wear the clothes as they were, M. Huc
adopting the expedient of holding up, by means of a girdle, the
surplus of his robe, and M. Gabet resigning himself to the
exposure to the public gaze of a portion of his legs; the main
inconvenience, after all, being the manifestation to all who saw
us that we could not attire ourselves in exact proportion to our
size.</p>
<p>Provided with our sheep-skin coats, we next asked the dealer
to show us his collection of secondhand winter hats.&nbsp; We
examined several of these, and at last selected two caps of
fox-skin, the elegant form of which reminded us of the schakos of
our sappers.&nbsp; These purchases completed, each of us put
under his arm his packet of old clothes, and we returned to the
hotel of the &ldquo;Three Perfections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We remained two days longer at Koukou-Khoton; for, besides
that we needed repose, we were glad of the opportunity of seeing
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>this great town, and of becoming acquainted with the
numerous and celebrated Lamaseries established there.</p>
<p>The Blue Town enjoys considerable commercial importance, which
it has acquired chiefly through its Lamaseries, the reputation of
which attracts thither Mongols from the most distant parts of the
empire.&nbsp; The Mongols bring hither large herds of oxen,
camels, horses, sheep, and loads of furs, mushrooms, and salt,
the only produce of the deserts of Tartary.&nbsp; They receive,
in return, brick-tea, linen, saddlery, odoriferous sticks to burn
before their idols, oatmeal, millet, and kitchen utensils.</p>
<p>The Blue Town is especially noted for its great trade in
camels.&nbsp; The camel market is a large square in the centre of
the town; the animals are ranged here in long rows, their front
feet raised upon a mud elevation constructed for that purpose,
the object being to show off the size and height of the
creatures.&nbsp; It is impossible to describe the uproar and
confusion of this market, what with the incessant bawling of the
buyers and sellers as they dispute, their noisy chattering after
they have agreed, and the horrible shrieking of the camels at
having their noses pulled, for the purpose of making them show
their agility in kneeling and rising.&nbsp; In order to test the
strength of the camel, and the burden it is capable of bearing,
they make it kneel, and then pile one thing after another upon
its back, causing it to rise under each addition, until it can
rise no longer.&nbsp; They sometimes use the following expedient:
While the camel is kneeling, a man gets upon its hind heels, and
holds on by the long hair of its hump; if the camel can rise
then, it is considered an animal of superior power.</p>
<p>The trade in camels is entirely conducted by proxy: the seller
and the buyer never settle the matter between themselves.&nbsp;
They select indifferent persons to sell their goods, who propose,
discuss, and fix the price; the one looking to the interests of
the seller, the other to those of the purchaser.&nbsp; These
&ldquo;sale-speakers&rdquo; exercise no other trade; they go from
market to market to promote business, as they say.&nbsp; They
have generally a great knowledge of cattle, have much fluency of
tongue, and are, above all, endowed with a knavery beyond all
shame.&nbsp; They dispute, by turns, furiously and
argumentatively, as to the merits and defects of the animal; but
as soon as it comes to a question of price, the tongue is laid
aside as a medium, and the conversation proceeds altogether in
signs.&nbsp; They seize each other by the wrist, and beneath the
long wide sleeve of their jackets, indicate with their fingers
the progress of the bargain.&nbsp; After the affair is concluded
they partake of the dinner, which is always given by the
purchaser, and then receive a certain number of sapeks, according
to the custom of different places.</p>

<p>In the Blue Town there exist five great Lamaseries, each
inhabited by more than 2,000 Lamas; besides these, they reckon
fifteen less considerable establishments&mdash;branches, as it
were, of the former.&nbsp; The number of regular Lamas resident
in this city may fairly be stated at 20,000.&nbsp; As to those
who inhabit the different quarters of the town, engaged in
commerce and horse-dealing, they are innumerable.&nbsp; The
Lamasery of the Five Towers is the finest and the most famous:
here it is that the Hobilgan lives&mdash;that is, a Grand
Lama&mdash;who, after having been identified with the substance
of Buddha, has already undergone several times the process of
transmigration.&nbsp; He sits here upon the altar once occupied
by the Guison-Tamba, having ascended it after a tragical event,
which very nearly brought about a revolution in the empire.</p>
<p>The Emperor Khang-Hi, during the great military expedition
which he made in the West against the Oelets, one day, in
traversing the Blue Town, expressed a wish to pay a visit to the
Guison-Tamba, at that time the Grand Lama of the Five
Towers.&nbsp; The latter received the Emperor without rising from
the throne, or manifesting any kind of respect.&nbsp; Just as
Khang-Hi drew near to speak to him, a Kian-Kan, or high military
Mandarin, indignant at this unceremonious treatment of his
master, drew his sabre, fell <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>upon the
Guison-Tamba, and laid him dead on the steps of his throne.&nbsp;
This terrible event roused the whole Lamasery, and indignation
quickly communicated itself to all the Lamas of the Blue
Town.</p>
<p>They ran to arms in every quarter, and the life of the
Emperor, who had but a small retinue, was exposed to the greatest
danger.&nbsp; In order to calm the irritation of the Lamas, he
publicly reproached the Kian-Kan with his violence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If the Guison-Tamba,&rdquo; answered the Kian-Kan,
&ldquo;was not a living Buddha, why did he not rise in the
presence of the master of the universe?&nbsp; If he was a living
Buddha, how was it he did not know I was going to kill
him?&rdquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile the danger to the life of the Emperor
became every moment more imminent; he had no other means of
escape than that of taking off his imperial robes, and attiring
himself in the dress of a private soldier.&nbsp; Under favour of
this disguise, and the general confusion, he was enabled to
rejoin his army, which was near at hand.&nbsp; The greater part
of the men who had accompanied the Emperor into the Blue Town
were massacred, and among the rest, the murderer of the
Guison-Tamba.</p>
<p>The Mongols sought to profit by this movement.&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards it was announced that the Guison-Tamba had
re-appeared, and that he had transmigrated to the country of the
Khalkhas, who had taken him under their protection, and had sworn
to avenge his murder.&nbsp; The Lamas of the Great Kouren set
actively to the work of organization.&nbsp; They stripped off
their red and yellow robes, clothed themselves in black, in
memory of the disastrous event of the Blue Town, and allowed the
hair and beard to grow, in sign of grief.&nbsp; Everything seemed
to presage a grand rising of the Tartar tribes.&nbsp; The great
energy and rare diplomatic talents of the Emperor Khang-Hi alone
sufficed to arrest its progress.&nbsp; He immediately opened
negotiations with the Tal&eacute;-Lama, Sovereign of Thibet, who
was induced to use all his influence with the Lamas for the
re-establishment of order, whilst Khang-Hi was intimidating the
Khalkha kings by means of his troops.&nbsp; Gradually peace was
restored; the Lamas resumed their red and yellow robes; but, as a
memorial of their coalition in favour of the Guison-Tamba, they
retained a narrow border of black on the collar of their
robes.&nbsp; Khalkha Lamas alone bear this badge of
distinction.</p>
<p>Ever since that period, a Hobilgan has taken the place in the
Blue Town of the Guison-Tamba, who himself is resident at the
great Kouren, in the district of the Khalkhas.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
the Emperor Khang-Hi, whose penetrating genius was always
occupied with the future, was not entirely satisfied with these
arrangements.&nbsp; He did not believe in all these doctrines of
transmigration, and <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>clearly saw that the Khalkhas, in
pretending that the Guison-Tamba had re-appeared among them, had
no other end than that of keeping at their disposal a power
capable of contending, upon occasion, with that of the Chinese
Emperor.&nbsp; To abolish the office of Guison-Tamba would have
been a desperate affair; the only course was, whilst tolerating
him, to neutralise his influence.&nbsp; It was decreed, with the
concurrence of the Court of Lha-Ssa, that the Guison-Tamba should
be recognised legitimate sovereign of the great Kouren; but that
after his successive deaths, he should always be bound to make
his transmigration to Thibet.&nbsp; Khang-Hi had good reason to
believe that a Thibetian by origin, would espouse with reluctance
the resentments of the Khalkhas against the Court of Peking.</p>
<p>The Guison-Tamba, full of submission and respect for the
orders of Khang-Hi and of the Tal&eacute;-Lama, has never failed
since that to go and accomplish his metempsychosis in
Thibet.&nbsp; Still, as they fetch him whilst he is yet an
infant, he must necessarily be influenced by those about him; and
it is said, that as he grows up, he imbibes sentiments little
favourable to the reigning dynasty.&nbsp; In 1839, when the
Guison-Tamba made that journey to Peking, of which we have
spoken, the alarm manifested by the Court arose from the
recollection of these events.&nbsp; The Lamas who flock from all
the districts of Tartary to the Lamaseries of the Blue Town,
rarely remain there permanently.&nbsp; After taking their
degrees, as it were, in these quasi universities, they return,
one class of them, to their own countries, where they either
settle in the small Lamaseries, wherein they can be more
independent, or live at home with their families; retaining of
their order little more than its red and yellow habit.</p>
<p>Another class consists of those Lamas who live neither in
Lamaseries nor at home with their families, but spend their time
vagabondizing about like birds of passage, travelling all over
their own and the adjacent countries, and subsisting upon the
rude hospitality which, in Lamasery and in tent they are sure to
receive, throughout their wandering way.&nbsp; Lamasery or tent,
they enter without ceremony, seat themselves, and while the tea
is preparing for their refreshment, give their hosts an account
of the places they have visited in their rambles.&nbsp; If they
think fit to sleep where they are, they stretch themselves on the
floor and repose until the morning.&nbsp; After breakfast, they
stand at the entrance of the tent, and watch the clouds for a
while, and see whence the wind blows; then they take their way,
no matter whither, by this path or that, east or west, north or
south, as their fancy or a smoother turf suggests, and lounge
tranquilly on, sure at least, if no other shelter presents <!--
page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>itself by-and-by, of the shelter of the cover, as they
express it, of that great tent, the world; and sure, moreover,
having no destination before them, never to lose their way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The wandering Lamas visit all the countries readily accessible
to them:&mdash;China, Mantchouria, the Khalkhas, the various
kingdoms of Southern Mongolia, the Ourianghai, the Koukou-Noor,
the northern and southern slopes of the Celestial Mountains,
Thibet, India, and sometimes even Turkestan.&nbsp; There is no
stream which they have not crossed, no mountains they have not
climbed, no Grand Lama before whom they have not prostrated
themselves, no people with whom they have not associated, and
whose customs and language are unknown to them.&nbsp; Travelling
without any end in view, the places they reach are always those
they sought.&nbsp; The story of the Wandering Jew, who is for
ever a wanderer, is exactly realised in these Lamas.&nbsp; They
seem influenced by some secret power, which makes them wander
unceasingly from place to place.&nbsp; God seems to have infused
into the blood which flows in their veins, something of that
motive power which propels them on their way, without allowing
them to stop.</p>
<p>The Lamas living in community are those who compose the <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>third class.&nbsp; A Lamasery is a collection of small
houses built around one or more Buddhic temples.&nbsp; These
dwellings are more or less large and beautiful, according to the
means of the proprietor.&nbsp; The Lamas who live thus in
community, are generally more regular than the others; they pay
more attention to prayer and study.&nbsp; They are allowed to
keep a few animals; some cows to afford them milk and butter, the
principal materials of their daily food; horses; and some sheep
to be killed on festivals.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Lamaseries have endowments, either
royal or imperial.&nbsp; At certain periods of the year, the
revenues are distributed to the Lamas according to the station
which they have obtained in the hierarchy.&nbsp; Those who have
the reputation of being learned physicians, or able
fortune-tellers, have often the opportunity of acquiring
possession of the property of strangers; yet they seldom seem to
become rich.&nbsp; A childish and heedless race, they cannot make
a moderate use of the riches they acquire; their money goes as
quickly as it comes.&nbsp; The same Lama whom you saw yesterday
in dirty, torn rags, to-day rivals in the magnificence of his
attire the grandeur of the highest dignitaries of the
Lamasery.&nbsp; So soon as animals or money are placed within his
disposition, he starts off to the next trading town, sells what
he has to sell, and clothes himself in the richest attire he can
purchase.&nbsp; For a month or two he plays the elegant idler,
and then, his money all gone, he repairs once more to the Chinese
town, this time to pawn his fine clothes for what he can get, and
with the certainty that once in the Tang-Pou, he will never,
except by some chance, redeem them.&nbsp; All the pawnbrokers
shops in the Tartar Chinese towns are full of these Lama
relics.&nbsp; The Lamas are very numerous in Tartary; we think we
may affirm, without exaggeration, that they compose at least a
third of the population.&nbsp; In almost all families, with the
exception of the eldest son, who remains a layman, the male
children become Lamas.</p>
<p>The Tartars embrace this profession compulsorily, not of their
own free will; they are Lamas or laymen from their birth,
according to the will of the parents.&nbsp; But as they grow up,
they grow accustomed to this life; and, in the end, religious
exaltation attaches them strongly to it.</p>
<p>It is said that the policy of the Mantchou dynasty is to
increase the number of Lamas in Tartary; the Chinese Mandarins so
assured us, and the thing seems probable enough.&nbsp; It is
certain that the government of Peking, whilst it leaves to
poverty and want the Chinese Bonzes, honours and favours Lamanism
in a special degree.&nbsp; The secret intention of the
government, in augmenting the number of the Lamas, who are bound
to celibacy, is to arrest, <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>by this
means, the progress of the population in Tartary.&nbsp; The
recollection of the former power of the Mongols ever fills its
mind; it knows that they were formerly masters of the
empire,&mdash;and in the fear of a new invasion, it seeks to
enfeeble them by all the means in its power.&nbsp; Yet, although
Mongolia is scantily peopled, in comparison with its immense
extent, it could, at a day&rsquo;s notice, send forth a
formidable army.&nbsp; A high Lama, the Guison-Tamba, for
instance, would have but to raise his finger, and all the
Mongols, from the frontiers of Siberia to the extremities of
Thibet, rising as one man, would precipitate themselves like a
torrent wherever their sainted leader might direct them.&nbsp;
The profound peace which they have enjoyed for more than two
centuries, might seem to have necessarily enervated their warlike
character; nevertheless, you may still observe that they have not
altogether lost their taste for warlike adventures.&nbsp; The
great campaigns of Tsing-Kis-Khan, who led them to the conquest
of the world, have not escaped their memory during the long
period of leisure of their nomadic life; they love to talk of
them, and to feed their imagination with vague projects of
invasion.</p>
<p>During our short stay at the Blue Town we had constant
conversations with the Lamas of the most celebrated Lamaseries,
endeavouring to obtain fresh information on the state of Buddhism
in Tartary and Thibet.&nbsp; All they told us only served to
confirm us more and more in what we had before learnt on this
subject.&nbsp; In the Blue Town, as at Tolon-Noor, everyone told
us that the doctrine would appear more sublime and more luminous
as we advanced towards the West.&nbsp; From what the Lamas said,
who had visited Thibet, Lha-Ssa was, as it were, a great focus of
light, the rays of which grew more and more feeble in proportion
as they became removed from their centre.</p>
<p>One day we had an opportunity of talking with a Thibetian Lama
for some time, and the things he told us about religion astounded
us greatly.&nbsp; A brief explanation of the Christian doctrine,
which we gave to him, seemed scarcely to surprise him; he even
maintained that our views differed little from those of the Grand
Lamas of Thibet.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must not confound,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;religious truths with the superstitions of the
vulgar.&nbsp; The Tartars, poor, simple people, prostrate
themselves before whatever they see; everything with them is
Borhan.&nbsp; Lamas, prayer books, temples, Lamaseries, stones,
heaps of bones,&mdash;&rsquo;tis all the same to them; down they
go on their knees, crying, Borhan!&nbsp; Borhan!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But the Lamas themselves admit innumerable
Borhans?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me explain,&rdquo; said our
friend, smilingly; &ldquo;there is but one sole Sovereign of the
universe, the Creator of all things, alike without beginning and
<!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>without end.&nbsp; In Dchagar (India) he bears the name
of Buddha, in Thibet, that of Samtche Mitcheba (all Powerful
Eternal); the Dcha-Mi (Chinese) call him Fo, and the Sok-Po-Mi
(Tartars), Borhan.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You say that Buddha is
sole; in that case, who are the Tal&eacute;-Lama of Lha-Ssa, the
Bandchan of Djachi-Loumbo, the Tsong-Kaba of the Sifan, the
Kaldan of Tolon-Noor, the Guison-Tamba of the Great Kouren, the
Hobilgan of Blue Town, the Hotoktou of Peking, the Chaberon of
the Tartar and Thibetian Lamaseries generally?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are all equally Buddha.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Buddha
visible?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, he is without a body; he is a
spiritual substance.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So, Buddha is sole, and
yet there exist innumerable Buddhas; the Tal&eacute;-Lama, and so
on.&nbsp; Buddha is incorporeal; he cannot be seen, and yet the
Tal&eacute;-Lama, the Guison-Tamba, and the rest are visible, and
have bodies like our own.&nbsp; How do you explain all
this?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The doctrine, I tell you, is
true,&rdquo; said the Lama, raising his arm, and assuming a
remarkable accent of authority; &ldquo;it is the doctrine of the
West, but it is of unfathomable profundity.&nbsp; It cannot be
sounded to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words of the Thibetian Lama astonished us strangely; the
Unity of God, the mystery of the Incarnation, the dogma of the
Real Presence seemed to us enveloped in his creed; yet with ideas
so sound in appearance, he admitted the metempsychosis, and a
sort of pantheism of which he could give no account.</p>
<p>These new indications respecting the religion of Buddha gave
us hopes that we should really find among the Lamas of Thibet
symbolism more refined and superior to the common belief, and
confirmed us in the resolution we had adopted, of keeping on our
course westward.</p>
<p>Previous to quitting the inn we called in the landlord, to
settle our bill.&nbsp; We had calculated that the entertainment,
during four days, of three men and our animals, would cost us at
least two ounces of silver; we were therefore agreeably surprised
to hear the landlord say, &ldquo;Sirs Lamas, there is no occasion
for going into any accounts; put 300 sapeks into the till, and
that will do very well.&nbsp; My house,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;is recently established, and I want to give it a good
character.&nbsp; You are come from a distant land, and I would
enable you to say to your countrymen that my establishment is
worthy of their confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; We replied that we would
everywhere mention his disinterestedness; and that our
countrymen, whenever they had occasion to visit the Blue Town,
would certainly not fail to put-up at the &ldquo;Hotel of the
Three Perfections.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A Tartar-eater&mdash;Loss of

Inns&mdash;We take up our abode with a Shepherd&mdash;Overflow of

Country&mdash;Encampment on the Banks of the River.</p>
<p>We quitted the Blue Town on the fourth day of the ninth
moon.&nbsp; We had already been travelling more than a
month.&nbsp; It was with the utmost difficulty that our little
caravan could get out of the town.&nbsp; The streets were
encumbered with men, cars, animals, stalls in which the traders
displayed their goods; we could only advance step by step, and at
times we were obliged to come to a halt, and wait for some
minutes until the way became a little cleared.&nbsp; It was near
noon before we reached the last houses of the town, outside the
western gate.&nbsp; There, upon a level road, our camels were at
length able to proceed at their ease in all the fulness of their
long step.&nbsp; A chain of rugged rocks rising on our right
sheltered us so completely from the north wind, that we did not
at all feel the rigour of the weather.&nbsp; The country through
which we were now travelling was still a portion of Western
Toumet.&nbsp; We observed in all directions the same indications
of <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>prosperity and comfort which had so much gratified us
east of the town.&nbsp; Everywhere around substantial villages
presented proofs of successful agriculture and trade.&nbsp;
Although we could not set up our tent in the cultivated fields by
which we were now surrounded, yet, so far as circumstances
permitted, we adhered to our Tartar habits.&nbsp; Instead of
entering an inn to take our morning meal, we seated ourselves
under a rock or tree, and there breakfasted upon some rolls fried
in oil, of which we had bought a supply at the Blue Town.&nbsp;
The passers-by laughed at this rustic proceeding, but they were
not surprised at it.&nbsp; Tartars, unused to the manners of
civilised nations, are entitled to take their repast by the
roadside even in places where inns abound.</p>
<p>During the day this mode of travelling was pleasant and
convenient enough; but, as it would not have been prudent to
remain out all night, at sunset we sought an inn: the
preservation of our animals of itself sufficed to render this
proceeding necessary.&nbsp; There was nothing for them to eat on
the way side, and had we not resorted in the evening to places
where we could purchase forage for them, they would, of course,
have speedily died.</p>
<p>On the second evening after our departure from Blue Town, we
encountered at an inn a very singular personage.&nbsp; We had
just tied our animals to a manger under a shed in the great
court, when a traveller made his appearance, leading by a halter
a lean, raw-boned horse.&nbsp; The traveller was short, but then
his rotundity was prodigious.&nbsp; He wore on his head a great
straw hat, the flapping brim of which rested on his shoulders; a
long sabre suspended from his girdle presented an amusing
contrast with the peaceful joyousness of his physiognomy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Superintendent of the soup-kettle,&rdquo; cried he, as he
entered, &ldquo;is there room for me in your tavern?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have but one travellers&rsquo; room,&rdquo; answered the
innkeeper, &ldquo;and three Mongols who have just come occupy it;
you can ask them if they will make room for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
traveller waddled towards us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace and happiness
unto you, Sirs Lamas: do you need the whole of your room, or can
you accommodate me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; We are all
travellers, and should serve one another.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Words of excellence!&nbsp; You are Tartars; I am Chinese,
yet, comprehending the claims of hospitality, you act upon the
truth, that all men are brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hereupon,
fastening his horse to a manger, he joined us, and, having
deposited his travelling-bag upon the kang, stretched himself at
full length, with the air of a man greatly fatigued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whither are you bound?&rdquo; asked we; &ldquo;are you
going to buy up salt or catsup for some Chinese
company?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No; I represent a great commercial
house at Peking, and I am collecting some debts from the
Tartars.&nbsp; Where are you going?&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&ldquo;We shall to-day pass the Yellow River to Tchagan
Kouren, and then journey westward through the country of the
Ortous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not Mongols,
apparently?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No; we are from the
West.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it seems we are both of one
trade; you, like myself, are Tartar-eaters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tartar-eaters!&nbsp; What do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, we eat the Tartars.&nbsp; You eat them by prayers; I
by commerce.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; The Mongols are poor
simpletons, and we may as well get their money as anybody
else.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are mistaken.&nbsp; Since we
entered Tartary we have spent a great deal, but we have never
taken a single sapek from the Tartar.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
nonsense!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What! do you suppose our camels and
our baggage came to us from the Mongols?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
I thought you came here to recite your prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
entered into some explanation of the difference between our
principles and those of the Lamas, for whom the traveller had
mistaken us, and he was altogether amazed at our
disinterestedness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things are quite the other way
here,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get a Lama to
say prayers for nothing; and certainly, as for me, I should never
set foot in Tartary but for the sake of money.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how is it you manage to make such good meals of the
Tartars?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, we devour them; we pick them
clean.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve observed the silly race, no doubt;
whatever they see when they come into our towns they want, and
when we know who they are, and where we can find them, we let
them have goods upon credit, of course at a considerable advance
upon the price, and upon interest at thirty or forty per cent.,
which is quite right and necessary.&nbsp; In China the
Emperor&rsquo;s laws do not allow this; it is only done with the
Tartars.&nbsp; Well, they don&rsquo;t pay the money, and the
interest goes on until there is a good sum owing worth the coming
for.&nbsp; When we come for it, they&rsquo;ve no money, so we
merely take all the cattle and sheep and horses we can get hold
of for the interest, and leave the capital debt and future
interest to be paid next time, and so it goes on from one
generation to another.&nbsp; Oh! a Tartar debt is a complete gold
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Day had not broken when the Yao-Tchang-Ti (exactor of debts)
was on foot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am
going to saddle my horse, and proceed on my way,&mdash;I propose
to travel to-day with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a
singular mode of travelling with people, to start before
they&rsquo;re up,&rdquo; said we.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, your camels go
faster than my horse; you&rsquo;ll soon overtake me, and we shall
enter Tchagan-Kouren (White Enclosure) together.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
rode off and at daybreak we followed him.&nbsp; This was a black
day with us, for in it we had to mourn a loss.&nbsp; After
travelling several hours, we perceived that Arsalan was not with
the caravan.&nbsp; We halted, and Samdadchiemba, mounted on his
little mule, turned back in search of the <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>dog.&nbsp;
He went through several villages which we had passed in the
course of the morning, but his search was fruitless; he returned
without having either seen or heard of Arsalan.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
dog was Chinese,&rdquo; said Samdadchiemba; &ldquo;he was not
used to a nomadic life, and getting tired of wandering about over
the desert, he has taken service in the cultivated
district.&nbsp; What is to be done?&nbsp; Shall we wait for
him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, it is late, and we are far from
White Enclosure.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, if there is no dog,
there is no dog; and we must do without him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
sentimental effusion of Samdadchiemba gravely delivered, we
proceeded on our way.</p>
<p>At first, the loss of Arsalan grieved us somewhat.&nbsp; We
were accustomed to see him running to and fro in the prairie,
rolling in the long grass, chasing the grey squirrels, and
scaring the eagles from their seat on the plain.&nbsp; His
incessant evolutions served to break the monotony of the country
through which we were passing, and to abridge, in some degree,
the tedious length of the way.&nbsp; His office of porter gave
him especial title to our regret.&nbsp; Yet, after the first
impulses of sorrow, reflection told us that the loss was not
altogether so serious as it had at first appeared.&nbsp; Each
day&rsquo;s experience of the nomadic life had served more and
more to dispel our original apprehension of robbers.&nbsp;
Moreover, Arsalan, under any circumstances, would have been a
very ineffective guard; for his incessant galloping about during
the day sent him at night into a sleep which nothing could
disturb.&nbsp; This was so much the case, that every morning,
make what noise we might in taking down our tent, loading the
camels, and so on, there would Arsalan remain, stretched on the
grass, sleeping a leaden sleep; and when the caravan was about to
start, we had always to arouse him with a sound kick or
two.&nbsp; Upon one occasion, a strange dog made his way into our
tent, without the smallest opposition on the part of Arsalan, and
had full time to devour our mess of oatmeal and a candle, the
wick of which he left contumeliously on the outside of the
tent.&nbsp; A consideration of economy completed our restoration
to tranquillity of mind: each day we had had to provide Arsalan
with a ration of meal, at least quite equal in quantity to that
which each of us consumed; and we were not rich enough to have
constantly seated at our table a guest with such excellent
appetite, and whose services were wholly inadequate to compensate
for the expense he occasioned.</p>
<p>We had been informed that we should reach White Enclosure the
same day, but the sun had set, and as yet we saw no signs of the
town before us.&nbsp; By-and-by, what seemed clouds of dust made
their appearance in the distance, approaching us.&nbsp; By
degrees they developed themselves in the form of camels, laden
with western <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>merchandise for sale in
Peking.&nbsp; When we met the first camel-driver, we asked him
how far it was from White Enclosure.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see
here,&rdquo; said he with a grin, &ldquo;one end of our caravan;
the other extremity is still within the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>

</a>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; cried we; &ldquo;in that case we shall
soon be there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve not more
than fifteen lis to go.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifteen lis! why
you&rsquo;ve just told us that the other end of your caravan is
still in the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So it is, but our <!--
page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>caravan consists of at least ten thousand
camels.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If that be the case,&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;there is no time to be lost: a good journey to you, and
peace,&rdquo; and on we went.</p>
<p>The cameleers had stamped upon their features, almost
blackened with the sun, a character of uncouth misanthropy.&nbsp;
Enveloped from head to foot in goatskins, they were placed
between the humps of their camels, just like bales of
merchandise; they scarcely condescended to turn even their heads
round to look at us.&nbsp; Five months journeying across the
desert seemed almost to have brutified them.&nbsp; All the camels
of this immense caravan wore suspended from their necks Thibetian
bells, the silvery sound of which produced a musical harmony
which contrasted very agreeably with the sullen taciturn aspect
of the drivers.&nbsp; In our progress, however, we contrived to
make them break silence from time to time; the roguish Dchiahour
attracted their attention to us in a very marked manner.&nbsp;
Some of the camels, more timid than others, took fright at the
little mule, which they doubtless imagined to be a wild
beast.&nbsp; In their endeavour to escape in an opposite
direction they drew after them the camels next following them in
the procession, so that, by this operation, the caravan assumed
the form of an immense bow.&nbsp; This abrupt evolution aroused
the cameleers from their sullen torpidity; they grumbled
bitterly, and directed fierce glances against us, as they exerted
themselves to restore the procession to its proper line.&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba, on the contrary, shouted with laughter; it was in
vain that we told him to ride somewhat apart in order not to
alarm the camels; he turned a deaf ear to all we said.&nbsp; The
discomfiture of the procession was quite a delightful
entertainment for him, and he made his little mule caracole about
in the hope of an encore.</p>
<p>The first cameleer had not deceived us.&nbsp; We journeyed on
between the apparently interminable file of the caravan, and a
chain of rugged rocks, until night had absolutely set in, and
even then we did not see the town.&nbsp; The last camel had
passed on, and we seemed alone in the desert, when a man came
riding by on a donkey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Elder brother,&rdquo; said
we, &ldquo;is White Enclosure still distant?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, brothers,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is just before
you, there, where you see the lights.&nbsp; You have not more
than five lis to go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Five lis!&nbsp; It was a long
way in the night, and upon a strange road, but we were fain to
resign ourselves.&nbsp; The night grew darker and darker.&nbsp;
There was no moon, no stars even, to guide us on our way.&nbsp;
We seemed advancing amid chaos and abysses.&nbsp; We resolved to
alight, in the hope of seeing our way somewhat more clearly: the
result was precisely the reverse; we would advance a few steps
gropingly and slowly; then, all of a sudden, we threw back our
<!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>heads in fear of dashing them against rocks or walls
that seemed to rise from an abyss.&nbsp; We speedily got covered
with perspiration, and were only happy to mount our camels once
more, and rely on their clearer sight and surer feet.&nbsp;
Fortunately the baggage was well secured: what misery would it
have been had that fallen off amid all this darkness, as it had
frequently done before!&nbsp; We arrived at last in
Tchagan-Kouren, but the difficulty now was to find an inn.&nbsp;
Every house was shut up, and there was not a living creature in
the streets, except a number of great dogs that ran barking after
us.</p>
<p>At length, after wandering haphazard through several streets,
we heard the strokes of a hammer upon an anvil.&nbsp; We
proceeded towards the sound, and before long, a great light, a
thick smoke, and sparks glittering in the air, announced that we
had come upon a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; We presented
ourselves at the door, and humbly entreated our brothers, the
smiths, to tell us where we should find an inn.&nbsp; After a few
jests upon Tartars and camels, the company assented to our
request, and a boy, lighting a torch, came out to act as our
guide to an inn.</p>
<p>After knocking and calling for a long time at the door of the
first inn we came to, the landlord opened it, and was inquiring
who we were, when, unluckily for us, one of our camels, worried
by a dog, took it into its head to send forth a succession of
those horrible cries for which the animal is remarkable.&nbsp;
The innkeeper at once shut his door in our faces.&nbsp; At all
the inns where we successively applied, we were received in much
the same manner.&nbsp; No sooner were the camels noticed than the
answer was, No room; in point of fact, no innkeeper, if he can
avoid it, will receive camels into his stables at all: their size
occupies great space, and their appearance almost invariably
creates alarm among the other animals; so that Chinese travellers
generally make it a condition with the landlord before they enter
an inn, that no Tartar caravan shall be admitted.&nbsp; Our guide
finding all our efforts futile, got tired of accompanying us,
wished us good night, and returned to his forge.</p>
<p>We were exhausted with weariness, hunger, and thirst, yet
there seemed no remedy for the evil, when all at once we heard
the bleating of sheep.&nbsp; Following the sound, we came to a
mud enclosure, the door of which was at once opened upon our
knocking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;is this an
inn?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, it is a sheep-house.&nbsp; Who are
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are travellers, who have arrived
here, weary and hungry; but no one will receive us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As we were speaking, an old man came to the door, holding in his
hand a lighted torch.&nbsp; As soon as he saw our camels and our
costume, &ldquo;Mendou!&nbsp; Mendou!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Sirs Lamas, enter; there is room for your <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>camels in the court, and my house is large enough for
you; you shall stay and rest here for several days.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We entered joyfully, fastened our camels to the manger, and
seated ourselves round the hearth, where already tea was prepared
for us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said we to the old man,
&ldquo;we need not ask whether it is to Mongols that we owe this
hospitality.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;we are all Mongols here.&nbsp; We have for some time past
quitted the tent, to reside here; so that we may better carry on
our trade in sheep.&nbsp; Alas! we are insensibly becoming
Chinese!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your manner of life,&rdquo; returned
we, &ldquo;may have changed, but it is certain that your hearts
have remained Tartar.&nbsp; Nowhere else in all Tchagan-Kouren,
has the door of kindness been opened to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observing our fatigue, the head of the family unrolled some
skins in a corner of the room, and we gladly laid ourselves down
to repose.&nbsp; We should have slept on till the morning, but
Samdadchiemba aroused us to partake of the supper which our hosts
had hospitably prepared&mdash;two large cups of tea, cakes baked
in the ashes, and some chops of boiled mutton, arranged on a
stool by way of a table.&nbsp; The meal seemed after our long
fasting, perfectly magnificent; we partook of it heartily, and
then having exchanged pinches of snuff with the family, resumed
our slumber.</p>
<p>Next morning we communicated the plan of our journey to our
Mongol hosts.&nbsp; No sooner had we mentioned that we intended
to pass the Yellow River, and thence traverse the country of the
Ortous, than the whole family burst out with exclamations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is quite impossible,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;to
cross the Yellow River.&nbsp; Eight days ago the river overflowed
its banks, and the plains on both sides are completely
inundated.&rdquo;&nbsp; This intelligence filled us with the
utmost consternation.&nbsp; We had been quite prepared to pass
the Yellow River under circumstances of danger arising from the
wretchedness of the ferry boats and the difficulty of managing
our camels in them, and we knew, of course, that the Hoang-Ho was
subject to periodical overflows; but these occur ordinarily in
the rainy season, towards the sixth or seventh month, whereas we
were now in the dry season, and, moreover, in a peculiarly dry
season.</p>
<p>We proceeded forthwith towards the river to investigate the
matter for ourselves, and found that the Tartar had only told us
the exact truth.&nbsp; The Yellow River had become, as it were, a
vast sea, the limits of which were scarcely visible.&nbsp; Here
and there you could see the higher grounds rising above the
water, like islands, while the houses and villages looked as
though they were floating upon the waves.&nbsp; We consulted
several persons as to the course we should adopt.&nbsp; Some said
that further progress was <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>impracticable, for that, even where the inundation had
subsided, it had left the earth so soft and slippery that the
camels could not walk upon it, while elsewhere we should have to
dread at every step some deep pool, in which we should inevitably
be drowned.&nbsp; Other opinions were more favourable, suggesting
that the boats which were stationed at intervals for the purpose
would easily and cheaply convey us and our baggage in three days
to the river, while the camels could follow us through the water,
and that once at the river side, the great ferry-boat would carry
us all over the bed of the stream without any difficulty.</p>
<p>What were we to do?&nbsp; To turn back was out of the
question.&nbsp; We had vowed that, God aiding, we would go to
Lha-Ssa whatever obstacles impeded.&nbsp; To turn the river by
coasting it northwards would materially augment the length of our
journey, and, moreover, compel us to traverse the great desert of
Gobi.&nbsp; To remain at Tchagan-Kouren, and patiently await for
a month the complete retirement of the waters and the restoration
of solidity in the roads, was, in one point of view, the most
prudent course, but there was a grave inconvenience about
it.&nbsp; We and our five animals could not live for a month in
an inn without occasioning a most alarming atrophy in our already
meagre purse.&nbsp; The only course remaining was to place
ourselves exclusively under the protection of Providence, and to
go on, regardless of mud or marsh.&nbsp; This resolution was
adopted, and we returned home to make the necessary
preparations.</p>
<p>Tchagan-Kouren is a large, fine town of recent
construction.&nbsp; It is not marked on the map of China compiled
by M. Andriveau-Goujon, doubtless because it did not exist at the
time when the Fathers Jesuits residing at Peking were directed by
the Emperor Khang-Hi to draw maps of the empire.&nbsp; Nowhere in
China, Mantchouria, or in Thibet, have we seen a town like White
Enclosure.&nbsp; The streets are wide, clean, and clear; the
houses regular in their arrangement, and of very fair
architecture.&nbsp; There are several squares, decorated with
trees, a feature which struck us all the more that we had not
observed it anywhere else in this part of the world.&nbsp; There
are plenty of shops, commodiously arranged, and well supplied
with Chinese, and even with European goods.&nbsp; The trade of
Tchagan-Kouren, however, is greatly checked by the proximity of
the Blue Town, to which, as a place of commerce, the Mongols have
been much longer accustomed.</p>
<p>Our worthy Tartar host, in his hospitality, sought to divert
us from our project, but unsuccessfully; and he even got rallied
by Samdadchiemba for his kindness.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
clear,&rdquo; said our guide, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve become a
mere Kitat (Chinese), and think that <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>a man must
not set out upon a journey unless the earth is perfectly dry and
the sky perfectly cloudless.&nbsp; I have no doubt you go out to
lead your sheep with an umbrella in one hand and a fan in the
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was ultimately arranged that we should
take our departure at daybreak next morning.</p>
<p>Meantime we went out into the town to make the necessary
supply of provisions.&nbsp; To guard against the possibility of
being inundation-bound for several days, we bought a quantity of
small loaves fried in mutton fat, and for our animals we procured
a quantity of the most portable forage we could find.</p>
<p>Next morning we departed full of confidence in the goodness of
God.&nbsp; Our Tartar host, who insisted upon escorting us out of
the town, led us to an elevation whence we could see in the
distance a long line of thick vapour which seemed journeying from
west to east; it marked the course of the Yellow River.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where you see that vapour,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;you will find a great dike, which serves to keep the river
in bounds, except upon any extraordinary rise of the
waters.&nbsp; That dike is now dry; when you come to it, proceed
along it until you reach the little pagoda you see yonder, on
your right; there you will find a boat that will convey you
across the river.&nbsp; Keep that pagoda in sight, and you
can&rsquo;t lose your way.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cordially thanked the
old man for the kindness he had shown us and proceeded on our
journey.</p>
<p>We were soon up to the knees of the camels in a thick slimy
compost of mud and water, covering other somewhat firmer mud,
over which the poor animals slowly slid on their painful way;
their heads turning alternately right and left, their limbs
trembling, and the sweat exuding from each pore.&nbsp; Every
moment we expected them to fall beneath us.&nbsp; It was near
noon ere we arrived at a little village, not more than a couple
of miles from the place where we had left the old man.&nbsp; Here
a few wretched people, whose rags scarce covered their gaunt
frames, came round us, and accompanied us to the edge of a broad
piece of water, portion of a lake, which they told us, and which,
it was quite clear, we must pass before we could reach the dike
indicated by the Tartar.&nbsp; Some boatmen proposed to carry us
over this lake to the dike.&nbsp; We asked them how many sapeks
they would charge for the service:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, very little;
next to nothing.&nbsp; You see we will take in our boats you, and
the baggage, and the mule, and the horse; one of our people will
lead the camels through the lake; they are too big to come into
the boat.&nbsp; When one comes to reckon on all this load, and
all the trouble and fatigue, the price seems absolutely less than
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;True, there will be some trouble in
the affair, no one denies it; but let us have a distinct
understanding.&nbsp; How many sapeks do <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>you
ask?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, scarcely any.&nbsp; We are all
brothers; and you, brothers, need all our assistance in
travelling.&nbsp; We know that; we feel it in our hearts.&nbsp;
If we could only afford it, we should have pleasure in carrying
you over for nothing; but look at our clothes.&nbsp; We poor
fellows are very poor.&nbsp; Our boat is all we have to depend
upon.&nbsp; It is necessary that we should gain a livelihood by
that; five lis sail, three men, a horse, a mule, and luggage; but
come, as you are spiritual persons, we will only charge you 2,000
sapeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The price was preposterous; we made no
answer.&nbsp; We took our animals by the bridle and turned back,
pretending that we would not continue our journey.&nbsp; Scarcely
had we advanced twenty paces before the ferryman ran after
us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas, are not you going to cross the water
in my boat?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said we drily,
&ldquo;doubtless you are too rich to take any trouble in the
matter.&nbsp; If you really wanted to let your boat, would you
ask 2,000 sapeks?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;2,000 sapeks is the price I
ask; but what will you give?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you like to
take 500 sapeks, let us set out at once; it is already
late.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Return, Sir Lamas; get into the
boat;&rdquo; and he caught hold, as he spoke, of the halters of
our beasts.&nbsp; We considered that the price was at last fixed;
but we had scarcely arrived on the border of the lake, when the
ferryman exclaimed to one of his comrades,&mdash;&ldquo;Come, our
fortune deserts us to-day; we must bear much fatigue for little
remuneration.&nbsp; We shall have to row five lis, and after all
we shall have only 1,500 sapeks to divide between eight of
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;1,500 sapeks!&rdquo; exclaimed we;
&ldquo;you are mocking us; we will leave you;&rdquo; and we
turned back for the second time.&nbsp; Some mediators, inevitable
persons in all Chinese matters, presented themselves, and
undertook to settle the fare.&nbsp; It was at length decided that
we should pay 800 sapeks; the sum was enormous, but we had no
other means of pursuing our way.&nbsp; The boatmen knew this, and
took accordingly the utmost advantage of our position.</p>
<p>The embarkation was effected with extraordinary celerity, and
we soon quitted the shore.&nbsp; Whilst we advanced by means of
the oars, on the surface of the lake, a man mounted on a camel
and leading two others after him, followed a path traced out by a
small boat rowed by a waterman.&nbsp; The latter was obliged
every now and then to sound the depth of the water, and the
camel-driver needed to be very attentive in directing his course
in the straight trail left by the boat, lest he should be
swallowed up in the holes beneath the water.&nbsp; The camels
advanced slowly, stretching out their long necks, and at times
leaving only their heads and the extremity of their humps visible
above the lake.&nbsp; We were in continual alarm; for these
animals not being able to swim, there only needed a false <!--
page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>step to precipitate them to the bottom.&nbsp; Thanks to
the protection of God, all arrived safe at the dike which had
been pointed out to us.&nbsp; The boatmen, after assisting us to
replace, in a hasty manner, our baggage on the camels, indicated
the point whither we must direct our steps.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
see, to the right, that small Miao? (pagoda).&nbsp; A little from
the Miao, do you observe those wooden huts and those black nets
hanging from long poles?&nbsp; There you will find the ferry-boat
to cross the river.&nbsp; Follow this dike, and go in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p139.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

src="images/p139.jpg" />
</a>After having proceeded with difficulty for half an hour, we
reached the ferry-boat.&nbsp; The boatmen immediately came to
us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;you intend,
doubtless, to cross the Hoang-Ho, but you see this evening the
thing is impracticable&mdash;the sun is just
setting!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are right; we will cross
to-morrow at daybreak: meanwhile, let us settle the price, so
that to-morrow we may lose no time in deliberation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The watermen would have preferred waiting till the morrow to
discuss this important point, expecting we should offer a much
larger sum, when just about to embark.&nbsp; At first their
demands were preposterous: happily, there were two boats which
competed together, otherwise we should have been ruined.&nbsp;
The price was ultimately fixed at 1,000 sapeks.&nbsp; The passage
was not long, it is true, for the river had nearly resumed its
bed; but the waters were very rapid, and, moreover the camels had
to ride.&nbsp; The amount, enormous in itself, appeared, upon the
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>whole, moderate, considering the difficulty and trouble
of the passage.&nbsp; This business arranged, we considered how
we should pass the night.&nbsp; We could not think of seeking an
asylum in the fishermen&rsquo;s cabins; even if they had been
sufficiently large, we should have had a considerable objection
to place our effects in the hands of these folks.&nbsp; We were
sufficiently acquainted with the Chinese not to trust to their
honesty.&nbsp; We looked out for a place whereon to set up our
tent; but we could find nowhere a spot sufficiently dry: mud or
stagnant water covered the ground in all directions.&nbsp; About
a hundred yards from the shore was a small Miao, or temple of
idols; a narrow, high path led to it.&nbsp; We proceeded thither
to see if we could find there a place of repose.&nbsp; It turned
out as we wished.&nbsp; A portico, supported by three stone
pillars, stood before the entrance door, which was secured by a
large padlock.&nbsp; This portico, made of granite, was raised a
few feet from the ground, and you ascended it by five
steps.&nbsp; We determined to pass the night here.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba asked us if it would not be a monstrous
superstition to sleep on the steps of a Miao.&nbsp; When we had
relieved his scruples, he made sundry philosophical
reflections.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a Miao
which has been built by the people of the country, in honour of
the god of the river.&nbsp; Yet, when it rained in Thibet, the
Pou-sa had no power to preserve itself from inundation.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, this Miao serves at present to shelter two
missionaries of Jehovah&mdash;the only real use it has ever
served.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our Dchiahour, who at first had scrupled to
lodge under the portico of this idolatrous temple, soon thought
the idea magnificent, and laughed hugely.</p>
<p>After having arranged our luggage in this singular encampment,
we proceeded to tell our beads on the shores of the
Hoang-Ho.&nbsp; The moon was brilliant, and lit up this immense
river, which rolled over an even and smooth bed its yellow and
tumultuous waters.&nbsp; The Hoang-Ho is beyond a doubt one of
the finest rivers in the world; it rises in the mountains of
Thibet, and crosses the Koukou-Noor, entering China by the
province of Kan-Sou.&nbsp; Thence it follows the sandy regions at
the feet of the Al&eacute;cha mountains, encircles the country of
the Ortous; and after having watered China first from north to
south, and then from west to east, it falls into the Yellow
Sea.&nbsp; The waters of the Hoang-Ho, pure and clear at their
source, only take the yellow hue after having passed the sands of
the Al&eacute;cha and the Ortous.&nbsp; They are almost,
throughout, level with the lands through which they flow, and it
is this circumstance which occasions those inundations so
disastrous to the Chinese.&nbsp; As for the Tartar nomads, when
the <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>waters rise, all they have to do is
to strike their tents, and drive their herds elsewhere. <a
name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a></p>
<p>Though the Yellow River had cost us so much trouble, we
derived much satisfaction from taking a walk at night upon its
solitary banks, and listening to the solemn murmur of its
majestic waters.&nbsp; We were contemplating this grand work of
nature, when Samdadchiemba recalled us to the prose of life, by
announcing that the oatmeal was ready.&nbsp; Our repast was as
brief as it was plain.&nbsp; We then stretched ourselves on our
goat-skins, in the portico, so that the three described the three
sides of a triangle, in the centre of which we piled our baggage;
for we had no faith at all that the sanctity of the place would
deter robbers, if robbers there were in the vicinity.</p>
<p>As we have mentioned, the little Miao was dedicated to the
divinity of the Yellow River.&nbsp; The idol, seated on a
pedestal of grey brick, was hideous, as all those idols are that
you ordinarily see in Chinese pagodas.&nbsp; From a broad, flat,
red face, rose two great staring eyes, like eggs stuck into
orbits, the smaller end projecting.&nbsp; Thick eyebrows, instead
of describing a horizontal line, began at the bottom of each ear,
and met in the middle of the forehead, so as to form an obtuse
angle.&nbsp; The idol had on its head a marine shell, and
brandished, with a menacing air, a sword like a scythe.&nbsp;
This Pou-sa had, right and left, two attendants, each putting out
its tongue, and apparently making faces at it.</p>
<p>Just as we were lying down, a man approached us, holding in
one hand a small paper lantern.&nbsp; He opened the grating which
led to the interior of the Miao, prostrated himself thrice,
burned incense in the censers, and lighted a small lamp at the
feet of the idol.&nbsp; This personage was not a bonze.&nbsp; His
hair, hanging in a tress, and his blue garments, showed him to be
a layman.&nbsp; When he had finished his idolatrous ceremonies,
he came to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will leave the door open,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll sleep more comfortably inside than
in the portico.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied we;
&ldquo;shut the door, however; for we shall do very well where we
are.&nbsp; Why have you been burning incense?&nbsp; Who is the
idol of this place?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>spirit of the Hoang-Ho, who inhabits this Miao.&nbsp; I
have burned incense before him, in order that our fishing may be
productive, and that our boats may float without
danger.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The words you utter,&rdquo; cried
Samdadchiemba, insolently, &ldquo;are mere <i>hou-choue</i>
(stuff and nonsense).&nbsp; How did it happen, that the other day
when the inundation took place, the Miao was flooded, and your
Pou-sa was covered with mud?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this sudden
apostrophe the pagan churchwarden made no answer, but took to his
heels.&nbsp; We were much surprised at this proceeding; but the
explanation came next morning.</p>
<p>We stretched ourselves on our goat-skins once more, and
endeavoured to sleep, but sleep came slowly and but for a brief
period.&nbsp; Placed between marshes and the river, we felt
throughout the night a piercing cold, which seemed to transfix us
to the very marrow.&nbsp; The sky was pure and serene, and in the
morning we saw that the marshes around were covered with a thick
sheet of ice.&nbsp; We made our preparations for departure, but
upon collecting the various articles, a handkerchief was
missing.&nbsp; We remembered that we had imprudently hung it upon
the grating at the entrance of the Miao, so that it was half in
and half out of the building.&nbsp; No person had been near the
place, except the man who had come to pay his devotions to the
idol.&nbsp; We could, therefore, without much rashness, attribute
the robbery to him, and this explained why he had made his exit
so rapidly, without replying to Samdadchiemba.&nbsp; We could
easily have found the man, for he was one of the fishermen
engaged upon the station, but it would have been a fruitless
labour.&nbsp; Our only effectual course would have been to seize
the thief in the fact.</p>
<p>Next morning, we placed our baggage upon the camels, and
proceeded to the river side, fully persuaded that we had a
miserable day before us.&nbsp; The camels having a horror of the
water, it is sometimes impossible to make them get into a
boat.&nbsp; You may pull their noses, or nearly kill them with
blows, yet not make them advance a step; they would die
sooner.&nbsp; The boat before us seemed especially to present
almost insurmountable obstacles.&nbsp; It was not flat and large,
like those which generally serve as ferry-boats.&nbsp; Its sides
were very high, so that the animals were obliged to leap over
them at the risk and peril of breaking their legs.&nbsp; If you
wanted to move a carriage into it, you had first of all to pull
the vehicle to pieces.</p>
<p>The boatmen had already taken hold of our baggage, for the
purpose of conveying it into their abominable vehicle, but we
stopped them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait a moment; we must first try and
get the camels in.&nbsp; If they won&rsquo;t enter the boat,
there is no use in placing the baggage <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>in
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence came your camels, that they
can&rsquo;t get into people&rsquo;s boats?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
matters little whence they came; what we tell you is that the
tall white camel has never hitherto consented to cross any river,
even in a flat boat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tall camel or short,
flat boat or high boat, into the boat the camel shall go,&rdquo;
and so saying, the ferryman ran and fetched an immense
cudgel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Catch hold of the string in the
camel&rsquo;s nose,&rdquo; cried he to a companion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t make the brute get into
the boat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man in the boat hauled at the string;
the man behind beat the animal vehemently on the legs with his
cudgel, but all to no purpose; the poor camel sent forth piercing
cries, and stretched out its long neck.&nbsp; The blood flowed
from its nostrils, the sweat from every pore; but not an inch
forward would the creature move; yet one step would have placed
it in the boat, the sides of which were touched by its fore
legs.</p>
<p>We could not endure the painful spectacle.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
more of this,&rdquo; we cried to the ferryman; &ldquo;it is
useless to beat the animal.&nbsp; You might break its legs or
kill it before it would consent to enter your boat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The two men at once left off, for they were tired, the one of
pulling, the other of beating.&nbsp; What were we to do?&nbsp; We
had almost made up our minds to ascend the banks of the river
until we found some flat boat, when the ferryman all at once
jumped up, radiant with an idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will make
another attempt,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and if that fails I give
the matter up.&nbsp; Take the string gently,&rdquo; he added, to
a companion, &ldquo;and keep the camel&rsquo;s feet as close as
ever you can to the side of the boat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, going
back for some paces, he dashed forward with a spring and threw
himself with all his weight upon the animal&rsquo;s rear.&nbsp;
The shock, so violent and unexpected, occasioned the camel
somewhat to bend its fore legs.&nbsp; A second shock immediately
succeeded the first, and the animal, in order to prevent itself
from falling into the water, had no remedy but to raise its feet
and place them within the boat.&nbsp; This effected, the rest was
easy.&nbsp; A few pinches of the nose and a few blows sufficed to
impel the hind legs after the fore, and the white camel was at
last in the boat, to the extreme satisfaction of all
present.&nbsp; The other animals were embarked after the same
fashion, and we proceeded on our watery way.</p>
<p>First, however, the ferryman deemed it necessary that the
animals should kneel, so that no movement of theirs on the river
might occasion an overturn.&nbsp; His proceeding to this effect
was exceedingly comic.&nbsp; He first went to one camel and then
to the other, pulling now this down, then that.&nbsp; When he
approached the larger animal, the creature, remembering the
man&rsquo;s treatment, discharged in his face a quantity of the
grass ruminating within its <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>jaws, a
compliment which the boatman returned by spitting in the
animal&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; And the absurdity was, that the work
made no progress.&nbsp; One camel was no sooner induced to kneel
down than the other got up, and so the men went backwards and
forwards, gradually covered by the angry creatures with the green
substance, half masticated and particularly inodorous, which each
animal in turns spat against him.&nbsp; At length, when
Samdadchiemba had sufficiently entertained himself with the
scene, he went to the camels, and, exercising his recognised
authority over them, made them kneel in the manner desired.</p>
<p>We at length floated upon the waters of the Yellow River; but
though there were four boatmen, their united strength could
scarcely make head against the force of the current.&nbsp; We had
effected about half our voyage, when a camel suddenly rose, and
shook the boat so violently that it was nearly upset.&nbsp; The
boatmen, after ejaculating a tremendous oath, told us to look
after our camels and prevent them from getting up, unless we
wanted the whole party to be engulfed.&nbsp; The danger was
indeed formidable.&nbsp; The camel, infirm upon its legs, and
yielding to every movement of the boat, menaced us with a
catastrophe.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba, however, managed to get quickly
beside the animal, and at once induced it to kneel, so that we
were let off with our fright, and in due course reached the other
side of the river.</p>
<p>At the moment of disembarkation, the horse, impatient to be
once more on land, leaped out of the boat, but striking, on its
way, against the anchor, fell on its side in the mud.&nbsp; The
ground not being yet dry, we were fain to take off our shoes, and
to carry the baggage on our shoulders to an adjacent eminence;
there we asked the boatmen if we should be any great length of
time in traversing the marsh and mud that lay stretched out
before us.&nbsp; The chief boatman raised his head, and after
looking for a while towards the sun, said: &ldquo;It will soon be
noon; by the evening you will reach the banks of the Little
River; to-morrow you will find the ground dry.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was under these melancholy auspices that we proceeded upon our
journey, through one of the most detestable districts to be found
in the whole world.</p>
<p>We had been told in what direction we were to proceed; but the
inundation had obliterated every trace of path and even of road,
and we could only regulate our course by the nature of the
ground, keeping as clear as we could of the deeper quagmires,
sometimes making a long circuit in order to reach what seemed
firmer ground, and then, finding the supposed solid turf to be
nothing more than a piece of water, green with stagnant matter
and aquatic plants, having to turn back, and, as it were, grope
one&rsquo;s way in another <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>direction,
fearful, at every step, of being plunged into some gulf of liquid
mud.</p>
<p>By-and-by, our animals alarmed and wearied, could hardly
proceed, and we were compelled to beat them severely and to
exhaust our voices with bawling at them before they would move at
all.&nbsp; The tall grass and plants of the marshes twisted about
their legs, and it was only by leaps, and at the risk of throwing
off both baggage and riders that they could extricate
themselves.&nbsp; Thrice did the youngest camel lose its balance
and fall; but on each occasion, the spot on which it fell was
providentially dry; had it stumbled in the mud, it would
inevitably have been stifled.</p>
<p>On our way, we met three Chinese travellers, who, by the aid
of long staves, were making their laborious way through the
marshes, carrying their shoes and clothes over their
shoulders.&nbsp; We asked them in what direction we were likely
to find a better road: &ldquo;You would have been wiser,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;had you remained at Tchagan-Kouren; foot
passengers can scarcely make their way through these marshes: how
do you suppose you can get on with your camels?&rdquo; and with
this consolatory assurance, they quitted us, giving us a look of
compassion, certain as they were that we should never get through
the mud.</p>
<p>The sun was just setting, when we perceived a Mongol
habitation; we made our way direct to it, without heeding the
difficulties of the road.&nbsp; In fact experience had already
taught us that selection was quite out of the question, and that
one way was as good as another in this universal slough.&nbsp;
Making circuits merely lengthened the journey.&nbsp; The Tartars
were frightened at our appearance, covered as we were with mud
and perspiration; they immediately gave us some tea, and
generously offered us the hospitality of their dwelling.&nbsp;
The small mud house in which they lived, though built upon an
eminence, had been half carried away by the inundation.&nbsp; We
could not conceive what had induced them to fix their abode in
this horrible district, but they told us that they were employed
to tend the herds belonging to some Chinese of
Tchagan-Kouren.&nbsp; After resting for a while, we requested
information as to the best route to pursue, and we were told that
the river was only five lis off, that its banks were dry, and
that we should find there boats to carry us to the other
side.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you have crossed the Paga-Gol,&rdquo;
(Little River,) said our hosts, &ldquo;you may proceed in peace;
you will meet with no more water to interrupt you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We thanked these good Tartars for their kindness, and resumed our
journey.</p>
<p>After half an hour&rsquo;s march, we discovered before us a
large extent of water, studded with fishing-vessels.&nbsp; The
title, Little <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>River, may, for anything we know, be
appropriate enough under ordinary circumstances, but at the time
of our visit, the Paga-Gol was a broad sea.&nbsp; We pitched our
tent on the bank which, by reason of its elevation, was perfectly
dry, and the remarkable excellence of the pasturage determined us
upon remaining in this place several days, in order to give rest
to our animals, which, since their departure from Tchagan-Kouren
had undergone enormous fatigue: we ourselves, too, felt the
necessity of some relaxation, after the sufferings which these
horrible marshes had inflicted upon us.</p>

Ortous&mdash;Encampment.</p>
<p>Upon taking possession of our post our first business was to
excavate a ditch round the tent, in order that, should rain
occur, the water might be carried into a pond below.&nbsp; The
excavated earth served to make a mound round the tent; and,
within, the packsaddles and furniture of the camels formed very
comfortable bedsteads for us.&nbsp; Having made our new
habitation as neat as possible, the next business was to make our
persons neat also.</p>
<p>We had now been travelling for nearly six weeks, and still
wore the same clothing we had assumed on our departure.&nbsp; The
incessant pricklings with which we were harassed, sufficiently
indicated that our attire was peopled with the filthy vermin to
which the Chinese and Tartars are familiarly accustomed, but
which with Europeans are objects of horror and
disgust,&mdash;lice, which of all <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>our
miseries on our long journey have been the greatest.&nbsp; Hunger
and thirst, fierce winds and piercing cold, wild beasts, robbers,
avalanches, menaced death and actual discomfort, all had been as
nothing compared with the incessant misery occasioned by these
dreadful vermin.</p>
<p>Before quitting Tchagen-Kouren we had bought in a
chemist&rsquo;s shop a few sapeks&rsquo; worth of mercury.&nbsp;
We now made with it a prompt and specific remedy against the
lice.&nbsp; We had formerly got this receipt from some Chinese,
and as it may be useful to others, we think it right to describe
it here.&nbsp; You take half-an-ounce of mercury, which you mix
with old tea-leaves, previously reduced to paste by
mastication.&nbsp; To render this softer, you generally add
saliva, water would not have the same effect.&nbsp; You must
afterwards bruise and stir it awhile, so that the mercury may be
divided into little balls as fine as dust.&nbsp; You infuse this
composition into a string of cotton, loosely twisted, which you
hang round the neck; the lice are sure to bite at the bait, and
they thereupon as surely swell, become red, and die
forthwith.&nbsp; In China and in Tartary you have to renew this
sanitary necklace once a month, for, otherwise, in these dirty
countries you could not possibly keep clear from vermin, which
swarm in every Chinese house and in every Mongol tent.</p>
<p>The Tartars are acquainted with the cheap and efficacious
anti-louse mixture I have described, but they make no use of
it.&nbsp; Accustomed from their infancy to live amid vermin, they
at last take no heed whatever of them, except, indeed, when the
number becomes so excessive as to involve the danger of their
being absolutely eaten up.&nbsp; Upon such a juncture they strip
off their clothes, and have a grand battue, all the members of
the family and any friends who may have dropped in, taking part
in the sport.&nbsp; Even Lamas, who may be present, share in the
hunt, with this distinction, that they do not kill the game, but
merely catch it and throw it away; the reason being, that,
according to the doctrine of metempsychosis, to kill any living
being whatever, is to incur the danger of homicide, since the
smallest insect before you may be the transmigration of a
man.&nbsp; Such is the general opinion; but we have met with
Lamas whose views on this subject were more enlightened.&nbsp;
They admitted that persons belonging to the sacerdotal class
should abstain from killing animals; but not, said they, in fear
of committing a murder by killing a man transmigrated into an
animal, but because to kill is essentially antagonistic with the
gentleness which should characterise a man of prayer, who is ever
in communication with the Deity.</p>
<p>There are some Lamas who carry this scruple to a point <!--
page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>approaching the puerile, so that as they ride along,
they are constantly manoeuvring their horses in and out, here and
there, in order to avoid trampling upon some insect or other that
presents itself in their path.&nbsp; Yet say they, the holiest
among them occasion inadvertently, the death, every day, of a
great many living creatures.&nbsp; It is to expiate these
involuntary murders that they undergo fasting and penitence, that
they recite certain prayers, and that they make prostrations.</p>
<p>We who had no such scruples, and whose conscience stood upon a
solid basis as to the transmigration of souls, concocted, as
effectively as possible, our anti-louse preparation, doubling the
dose of mercury in our anxiety to kill the greatest practicable
number of the vermin that had been so long tormenting us by day
and by night.</p>
<p>It would have been to little purpose merely to kill the
present vermin; it was necessary to withhold any sort of shelter
or encouragement from their too probable successors, and the
first point, with this view, was to wash all our under-clothing,
which, for some time past, had not been subjected to any such
operation.&nbsp; For nearly two months since our departure, we
had been wholly dependent, in all respects, upon ourselves, and
this necessity had compelled us to learn a little of various
professions with which we had been previously unacquainted;
becoming our own tailors and shoe menders, for example, when
clothes or shoes required repairs.&nbsp; The course of nomadic
life now practically introduced us also to the occupation of
washermen.&nbsp; After boiling some ashes and soaking our linen
in the lye, we next proceeded to wash it in an adjacent
pond.&nbsp; One great stone on which to place the linen when
washed, and another wherewith to beat it while washing, were our
only implements of trade; but we got on very well, for the
softness of the pond water gave every facility for cleansing the
articles.&nbsp; Before long, we had the delight of seeing our
linen once more clean; and when, having dried it on the grass, we
folded and took it home to our tent, we were quite radiant with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>The quiet and ease which we enjoyed in this encampment rapidly
remedied the fatigue we had undergone in the marshes.&nbsp; The
weather was magnificent; all that we could have possibly
desired.&nbsp; By day, a gentle, soothing heat; by night, a sky
pure and serene; plenty of fuel; excellent and abundant
pasturage; nitrous water, which our camels delighted in; in a
word, everything to renovate the health and revive the
spirits.&nbsp; Our rule of daily life may appear odd enough to
some, and perhaps not altogether in harmony with the regulations
of monastic houses, but it was in <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>exact
adaptation to the circumstances and wants of our little
community.</p>
<p>Every morning, with the first dawn, before the earliest rays
of the sun struck upon our tent, we rose spontaneously, requiring
neither call-bell nor valet to rouse us.&nbsp; Our brief toilette
made, we rolled up our goat-skins and placed them in a corner;
then we swept out the tent, and put the cooking utensils in
order, for we were desirous of having everything about us as
clean and comfortable as possible.&nbsp; All things go by
comparison in this world.&nbsp; The interior of our tent, which
would have made a European laugh, filled with admiration the
Tartars who from time to time paid us a visit.&nbsp; The
cleanliness of our wooden cups, our kettle always well polished,
our clothes not altogether as yet incrusted with grease; all this
contrasted favourably with the dirt and disorder of Tartar
habitations.</p>
<p>Having arranged our apartment, we said prayers together, and
then dispersed each apart in the desert to engage in meditation
upon some pious thought.&nbsp; Oh! little did we need, amid the
profound silence of those vast solitudes, a printed book to
suggest a subject for prayer!&nbsp; The void and vanity of all
things here below, the majesty of God, the inexhaustible measures
of his Providence, the shortness of life, the essentiality of
labouring with a view to the world to come, and a thousand other
salutary reflections, came of themselves, without any effort on
our parts, to occupy the mind with gentle musings.&nbsp; In the
desert the heart of man is free; he is subject to no species of
tyranny.&nbsp; Far away from us were all those hollow theories
and systems, those utopias of imaginary happiness which men are
constantly aiming at, and which as constantly evade their grasp;
those inexhaustible combinations of selfishness and
self-sufficiency, those burning passions which in Europe are ever
contending, ever fermenting in men&rsquo;s minds and hardening
their hearts.&nbsp; Amid these silent prairies there was nothing
to disturb our tranquil thoughts, or to prevent us from reducing
to their true value the futilities of this world, from
appreciating at their lofty worth the things of God and of
eternity.</p>
<p>The exercise which followed these meditations was, it must be
admitted, far from mystic in its character; but it was necessary,
and not wholly without entertainment in its course.&nbsp; Each of
us hung a bag from his shoulders and went in different directions
to seek argols for fuel.&nbsp; Those who have never led a nomadic
life will, of course, find it difficult to understand how this
occupation could possibly develope any enjoyment.&nbsp; Yet, when
one is lucky enough to find, half concealed among the grass, an
argol, recommendable for its size and dryness, there comes over
the heart a <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>gentle joy, one of those sudden
emotions which create a transient happiness.&nbsp; The pleasure
at finding a fine argol is cognate with that which the hunter
feels when he discovers the track of game, with which the boy
regards, his eyes sparkling, the linnet&rsquo;s nest be has long
sought; with which the fisherman sees quivering at the end of his
line a large fish; nay, if we may compare small things with
great, one might even compare this pleasure with the enthusiasm
of a Leverrier when he has discovered a new planet.</p>
<p>Our sack, once filled with argols, we returned, and piled the
contents with pride at the entrance of the tent; then we struck a
light and set the fire in movement; and while the tea was boiling
in the pot, pounded the meal and put some cakes to bake in the
ashes.&nbsp; The repast, it is observable, was simple and modest,
but it was always extremely delicious, first, because we had
prepared it ourselves, and secondly, because our appetites
provided most efficient seasoning.</p>
<p>After breakfast, while Samdadchiemba was collecting round the
tent the animals which had dispersed in search of pasturage, we
recited a portion of our breviary.&nbsp; Towards noon we indulged
in a brief repose, a few minutes of gentle but sound sleep, never
interrupted by nightmare or by unpleasant dreams.&nbsp; This
repose was all the more necessary that the evenings were
prolonged far into the night.&nbsp; It was always with difficulty
that we tore ourselves from our walks by moonlight on the banks
of the river.&nbsp; During the day all was silent and tranquil
around us; but so soon as the shades of night began to overspread
the desert, the scene became animated and noisy.&nbsp; Aquatic
birds, arriving in immense flocks, diffused themselves over the
various pools, and soon thousands of shrill cries filled the air
with wild harmony.&nbsp; The cries of anger, the accents of
passion, proceeding from those myriads of migratory birds, as
they disputed among themselves possession of the tufts of marsh
grass in which they desired to pass the night, gave one quite the
idea of a numerous people in all the fury of civil war, fighting
and clamouring, in agitation and violence, for some supposed
advantage, brief as this eastern night.</p>
<p>Tartary is populated with nomadic birds.&nbsp; Look up when
you may, you will see them floating high in air, the vast
battalions forming, in their systematically capricious flight, a
thousand fantastic outlines, dissipating as soon as formed,
forming again as soon as dissipated, like the creations of a
Kaleidoscope.&nbsp; Oh! how exactly are these migrant birds in
their place, amid the deserts of Tartary, where man himself is
never fixed in one spot, but is constantly on the move.&nbsp; It
was very pleasant to listen to the distant hum of these winged
bands, wandering about like ourselves.&nbsp; As <!-- page
152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>we
reflected upon their long peregrinations, and glanced in thought
over the countries which their rapid flight must have
comprehended, the recollection of our native land came vividly
before us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; we would say to each
other, &ldquo;who knows but that among these birds there are some
who have traversed&mdash;who have, perhaps, alighted for awhile
in our dear France: who have sought transient repose and
refreshment in the plains of Languedoc, or on the heights of the
Jura.&nbsp; After visiting our own country, they have doubtless
pursued their route towards the north of Europe, and have come
hither through the snows of Siberia, and of Upper Tartary.&nbsp;
Oh! if these birds could understand our words, or if we could
speak their tongue, how many questions should we not put to
them!&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas! we did not then know that for two years
more we should be deprived of all communication with our native
land.&nbsp; The migratory birds which visit Tartary are for the
most part known in Europe; such as wild geese, wild ducks, teal,
storks, bustards, and so on.&nbsp; There is one bird which may
deserve particular mention: the Youen-Yang, an aquatic bird
frequenting ponds and marshes; it is of the size and form of the
wild duck, but its beak, instead of being flat, is round, its red
head is sprinkled with white, its tail is black, and the rest of
its plumage a fine purple; its cry is exceedingly loud and
mournful, not the song of a bird, but a sort of clear, prolonged
sigh, resembling the plaintive tones of a man under
suffering.&nbsp; These birds always go in pairs; they frequent,
in an especial manner, desert and marshy places.&nbsp; You see
them incessantly skimming over the surface of the waters without
the couple ever separating from each other; if one flies away,
the other immediately follows; and that which dies first does not
leave its companion long in widowhood, for it is soon consumed by
sorrow and lonesomeness.&nbsp; Youen is the name of the male,
Yang that of the female: Youen-Yang their common
denomination.</p>
<p>We remarked in Tartary another species of migratory bird,
which offers various peculiarities singular in themselves, and
perhaps unknown to naturalists.&nbsp; It is about the size of a
quail; its eyes, of a brilliant black, are encircled by a
magnificent ring of azure; its body is of ash colour, speckled
with black; its legs, instead of feathers, are covered with a
sort of long, rough hair, like that of the musk-deer; its feet
are totally different from those of any other bird; they exactly
resemble the paws of the green lizard, and are covered with
scales so hard as to resist the edge of the sharpest knife.&nbsp;
This singular creature, therefore, partakes at once of the bird,
of the quadruped, and of the reptile.&nbsp; The Chinese call it
Loung-Kio (Dragon&rsquo;s Foot).&nbsp; These birds make their
periodical appearance in vast numbers from the north, <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>especially after a great fall of snow.&nbsp; They fly
with astonishing swiftness, and the movement of their wings makes
a loud, rattling noise, like that of heavy hail.</p>
<p>While we had the charge, in Northern Mongolia, of the little
christendom of the Valley of Black Waters, one of our Christians,
a skilful huntsman, brought us two of these birds which he had
caught alive.&nbsp; They were excessively ferocious; no sooner
was your hand extended to touch them, than the hair on their legs
bristled; and if you had the temerity to stroke them, you
instantly were assailed with vehement strokes of the bill.&nbsp;
The nature of these Dragon&rsquo;s Feet was evidently so wild as
to preclude the possibility of preserving them alive: they would
touch nothing we offered them.&nbsp; Perceiving, therefore, that
they must soon die of starvation, we determined to kill and eat
them; their flesh was of agreeable, pheasant-like savour, but
terribly tough.</p>
<p>The Tartars might easily take any number of these migratory
birds, especially of the wild geese and ducks, the crowds of
which are perfectly prodigious; and take them, moreover, without
the expenditure of a single ounce of powder, by merely laying
traps for them on the banks of the pools, or by surprising them
in the night, amongst the aquatic plants; but as we have before
observed, the flesh of wild creatures is not at all to the taste
of the Tartars; there is nothing to their palates at all
comparable with a joint of mutton, very fat and half boiled.</p>
<p>The Mongols are equally disinclined to fishing; and
accordingly, the highly productive lakes and ponds which one
meets with so frequently in Tartary, have become the property of
Chinese speculators, who, with the characteristic knavery of
their nation, having first obtained from the Tartar kings
permission to fish in their states, have gradually converted this
toleration into a monopoly most rigorously enforced.&nbsp; The
Paga-Gol (Little River), near which we were now encamped, has
several Chinese fishing stations upon its banks.&nbsp; This
Paga-Gol is formed by the junction of two rivers, which, taking
their source from the two sides of a hill, flow in opposite
directions; the one, running towards the north, falls into the
Yellow River; the other, proceeding southwards, swells the
current of another stream, which itself also falls into the
Hoang-Ho; but at the time of the great inundations, the two
rivers, in common with the hill which separates their course, all
alike disappear.&nbsp; The overflowing of the Hoang-Ho reunites
the two currents, and that which then presents itself is a large
expanse of water, the breadth of which extends to nearly two
miles.&nbsp; At this period, the fish which abound in the Yellow
River repair in shoals to this new basin, wherein the waters
remain collected until the <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>commencement of the winter; and during the autumn, this
little sea is covered in all directions with the boats of Chinese
fishermen, whose habitations for the fishing season are miserable
cabins constructed on either bank.</p>
<p>During the first night of our encampment in this locality, we
were kept awake by a strange noise, constantly recurring in the
distance: as it seemed to us, the muffled and irregular roll of
drums; with day-break the noise continued, but more intermittent
and less loud; it apparently came from the water.&nbsp; We went
out and proceeded towards the bank of the lake, where a
fisherman, who was boiling his tea in a little kettle, supported
by three stones, explained the mystery; he told us that during
the night, all the fishermen seated in their barks, keep moving
over the water, in all directions, beating wooden drums for the
purpose of alarming the fish, and driving them towards the places
where the nets are spread.&nbsp; The poor man whom we
interrogated had himself passed the whole night in this painful
toil.&nbsp; His red, swollen eyes and his drawn face clearly
indicated that it was long since he had enjoyed adequate
rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have a
great deal of work upon our hands; there is no time to be lost if
we wish to make any money of the business.&nbsp; The fishing
season is very short; at the outside not more than three months;
and a few days hence we shall be obliged to withdraw.&nbsp; The
Paga-Gol will be frozen, and not a fish will be obtainable.&nbsp;
You see, Sirs Lamas, we have no time to lose.&nbsp; I have passed
all the night hunting the fish about; when I have drunk some tea
and eaten a few spoonfuls of oatmeal, I shall get into my boat,
and visit the nets I have laid out there westward; then I shall
deposit the fish I have taken in the osier reservoirs you see
yonder; then I shall examine my nets, and mend them if they need
mending; then I shall take a brief repose, and after that, when
the old grandfather (the sun) goes down, I shall once more cast
my nets; then I shall row over the water, now here, now there,
beating my drum, and so it goes on.&rdquo;&nbsp; These details
interested us, and as our occupations at the moment were not very
urgent, we asked the fisherman if he would allow us to accompany
him when he went to raise his nets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since personages
like you,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;do not disdain to get into
my poor boat and to view my unskilful and disagreeable fishing, I
accept the benefit you propose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hereupon we sat down
in a corner of his rustic hearth to wait until he had taken his
repast.&nbsp; The meal of the fisherman was as short as the
preparations for it had been hasty.&nbsp; When the tea was
sufficiently boiled, he poured out a basin full of it; threw into
this a handful of oatmeal, which he partially kneaded with his
fore finger; and then, after having <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>pressed it
a little, and rolled it into a sort of cake, he swallowed it
without any other preparation.&nbsp; After having three or four
times repeated the same operation, the dinner was at an
end.&nbsp; This manner of living had nothing in it to excite our
curiosity; having adopted the nomad way of living, a sufficiently
long experience had made it familiar to us.</p>

</a>We entered his small boat and proceeded to enjoy the pleasure
of fishing.&nbsp; After having relished for some moments the
delight of a quiet sail on the tranquil water, smooth and
unbroken as glass through troops of cormorants and wild geese,
which were disporting on the surface of the expanse, and which,
half running, half flying, made a free passage for us as we
advanced, we reached the place where the nets lay.&nbsp; At
intervals we saw pieces of wood floating on the water, to which
the nets were attached which rested at the bottom.&nbsp; When we
drew them up we saw the fish glitter as they struggled in the
meshes.&nbsp; These fish were generally large, but the fisherman
only kept the largest; those that were under half a pound he
threw back into the water.</p>
<p>After having examined a few of the nets, he stopped to see if
the haul had been productive.&nbsp; Already the two wells,
constructed <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>at the extremities of the boat, were
nearly full.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said the fisherman,
&ldquo;do you eat fish?&nbsp; I will sell you some if you
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this proposition, the two poor French
missionaries looked at each other without saying a word.&nbsp; In
that look you might see that they were by no means averse from
trying the flavour of the fish of the Yellow River, but that they
dared not, a sufficient reason keeping them in suspense.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do you sell your fish?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not dear;
eighty sapeks a pound.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Eighty sapeks! why
that is dearer than mutton.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You speak the
words of truth; but what is mutton compared with the fish of the
Hoang-Ho?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No matter; it is too dear for
us.&nbsp; We have still far to go; our purse is low, we must
economize.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fisherman did not insist; he took his
oar, and directed the boat towards those nets which had not yet
been drawn up from the water.&nbsp; &ldquo;For what
reason,&rdquo; asked we &ldquo;do you throw back so much
fish?&nbsp; Is it because the quality is inferior?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, no; all the fish in the Yellow River are excellent,
these are too small, that is all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, just
so; next year they will be bigger.&nbsp; It is a matter of
calculation; you refrain now, so that in the end you may get more
by them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fisherman laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we do not hope to re-capture
these fish.&nbsp; Every year the basin is filled with fresh fish,
brought hither by the overflowings of the Hoang-Ho; there come
great and small; we take the first; and the others we throw back,
because they do not sell well.&nbsp; The fish here are very
abundant.&nbsp; We are able to select the best . . . .&nbsp; Sirs
Lamas, if you like to have these little fish, I will not throw
them back.&rdquo;&nbsp; The offer was accepted, and the small
fry, as they came, were placed in a little basket.&nbsp; When the
fishing was over, we found ourselves possessors of a very
respectable supply of fish.&nbsp; Before leaving the boat, we
washed an old basket, and having deposited our fish in it, we
marched in triumph to the tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where have you
been?&rdquo; exclaimed Samdadchiemba, as soon as he saw us;
&ldquo;the tea is now boiled, and it soon gets cold: I have
boiled it up again; it has again got cold.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pour out some of your tea,&rdquo; answered we.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We will not have oatmeal to-day, but some fresh
fish.&nbsp; Place some loaves under the ashes to
bake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our prolonged absence had put Samdadchiemba in
an ill humour.&nbsp; His forehead was more contracted than usual,
and his small black eyes flashed with displeasure.&nbsp; But when
he beheld in the basket the fish which were still in motion, his
face relaxed into a smile, and his countenance insensibly grew
more cheerful.&nbsp; He opened smilingly the bag of flour, the
strings of which were never untied except on rare
occasions.&nbsp; Whilst he was busily occupied with the pastry,
we took some of the fish, and proceeded to the shores of a lake
at a short distance from the tent.&nbsp; We had scarcely got
there, when <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>Samdadchiemba ran to us with all his
might.&nbsp; He drew aside the four corners of the cloth which
contained the fish.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
said he, with an anxious air.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are going to cut
open and scale this fish.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that is not
well; my spiritual fathers, wait a little; you must not
transgress thus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you talking
about?&nbsp; Who is committing a sin?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
look at these fish; they are still moving.&nbsp; You must let
them die in peace, before you open them: is it not a sin to kill
a living creature?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go make your bread and let
us alone.&nbsp; Are we always to be pestered with your notions of
metempsychosis?&nbsp; Do you still think that men are transformed
into beasts, and beasts into men?&rdquo;&nbsp; The lips of our
Dchiahour opened for a long laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said
he, striking his forehead, &ldquo;what a thick head I have; I did
not think of that; I had forgotten the doctrine,&rdquo; and he
returned not a little ashamed at having come to give us such
ridiculous advice.</p>
<p>The fish were fried in mutton fat, and we found them
exquisite.</p>
<p>In Tartary and in the north of China, the fishing continues to
the commencement of winter, when the ponds and rivers are
frozen.&nbsp; At that time they expose to the air, in the night,
the fish they have kept alive in the reservoirs; these
immediately freeze, and may be laid up without trouble.&nbsp; It
is in this state that they are sold to the fishmongers.&nbsp;
During the long winters of the northern part of the empire, the
wealthy Chinese can always, by this means, procure fresh fish;
but great care must be taken not to make too large a provision of
them to be consumed during the time of the great frosts, for on
the first thaw the fish become putrid.</p>
<p>During our few days&rsquo; rest, we considered the means of
crossing the Paga-Gol.&nbsp; A Chinese family having obtained
from the King of the Ortous the privilege of conveying travellers
across, we were obliged to address ourselves to the master of the
boat.&nbsp; He had undertaken to conduct us to the other side,
but we had not yet agreed about the fare; he required upwards of
1,000 sapeks.&nbsp; The sum appeared to us exorbitant, and we
waited.</p>
<p>On the third day of our halt, we perceived a fisherman coming
towards our tent, dragging himself along with great difficulty by
the aid of a long staff.&nbsp; His pale and extremely meagre
face, showed that he was a man in suffering.&nbsp; As soon as he
had seated himself beside our hearth, &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said
we, &ldquo;it seems that your days are not happy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my misfortune is great, but
what am I to do?&nbsp; I must submit to the irrevocable laws of
heaven.&nbsp; It is now a fortnight since, as I was going to
visit a Mongol tent, I was bitten in the leg by a mad dog; there
has been formed a wound which grows larger and mortifies day by
day.&nbsp; They told me that you were from the Western Heaven,
and I am come to you.&nbsp; The <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>men of the
Western Heaven, say the Tartar Lamas, have an unlimited
power.&nbsp; With a single word they are able to cure the most
grievous disorders.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They have deceived you,
when they said we had such great powers;&rdquo; and hereupon we
took occasion to elucidate to this man the great truths of the
faith.&nbsp; But he was a Chinese, and, like all his nation, but
little heedful of religious matters.&nbsp; Our words only glanced
over his heart; his hurt absorbed all his thoughts.&nbsp; We
resolved to treat his case with the Kou-Kouo, or bean of St.
Ignatius.&nbsp; This vegetable, of a brown or ashy colour, and of
a substance which resembles horn, extremely hard, and of
intolerable bitterness, is a native of the Philippine
Isles.&nbsp; The manner of using the Kou-Kouo is to bruise it in
cold water, to which it communicates its bitterness.&nbsp; This
water, taken inwardly, modifies the heat of the blood, and
extinguishes internal inflammation.&nbsp; It is an excellent
specific for all sorts of wounds and contusions, and, enjoying a
high character in the Chinese Materia Medica, is sold in all
chemists&rsquo; shops.&nbsp; The veterinary doctors also apply it
with great success to the internal diseases of cattle and
sheep.&nbsp; In the north of China we have often witnessed the
salutary effects of the Kou-Kouo.</p>
<p>We infused the powder of one of these beans in some cold
water, with which we washed the poor man&rsquo;s wound, and we
supplied some clean linen, in place of the disgustingly dirty
rags which previously served for a bandage.&nbsp; When we had
done all we could for the sufferer, we observed that he still
seemed very embarrassed in his manner.&nbsp; His face was red
with blushes, he held down his eyes, and he began several
sentences which he could not complete.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;you have something on your
mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Holy personages, you see how poor I am!
you have tended my wound, and you have given me a great mug of
healing water to take; I know not what I can offer in exchange
for all this.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If this be the subject of your
uneasiness,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;be at once reassured.&nbsp; In
doing what we could for your leg, we only fulfilled a duty
commanded by our religion.&nbsp; The remedies we have prepared,
we freely give you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our words evidently relieved the
poor fisherman from a very grave embarrassment.&nbsp; He
immediately prostrated himself before us, and touched the ground
thrice with his forehead, in token of his gratitude.&nbsp; Before
withdrawing, he asked us whether we intended to remain where we
were for any length of time.&nbsp; We told him that we should
gladly depart the next day, but that we had not as yet agreed
with the ferryman as to the fare.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a
boat,&rdquo; said the fisherman, &ldquo;and since you have tended
my wound, I will endeavour to-morrow, to convey you over the
water.&nbsp; If my boat belonged entirely to myself, I would at
once undertake the matter; <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>but as I
have two partners, I must first get their consent.&nbsp;
Moreover, we must procure some particulars as to our course; we
fishermen are not acquainted with the depth of water at all the
points of the passage.&nbsp; There are dangerous places here and
there, which we must ascertain the exact nature and locality of
beforehand, so that we may not incur some misfortune.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t say anything more about the matter to the ferry
people.&nbsp; I will come back in the course of the evening, and
we will talk over the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words gave us hopes of being able to continue our
journey, without too heavy an outlay for the river passage.&nbsp;
As he had promised, the fisherman returned in the evening.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My partners,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;were not at first
willing to undertake this job, because it would lose them a
day&rsquo;s fishing.&nbsp; I promised that you would give them
400 sapeks, and so the affair was arranged.&nbsp; To-morrow we
will make inquiries as to the best course to follow on the
river.&nbsp; Next morning, before sun-rise, fold your tent, load
your camels, and come down to the river side.&nbsp; If you see
any of the ferry people, don&rsquo;t tell them you are going to
give us 400 sapeks.&nbsp; As they have the sole right of carrying
passengers for hire, they might prosecute us for carrying you, if
they knew you had paid us anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, we proceeded to the fisherman&rsquo;s
hut.&nbsp; In a minute the baggage was packed in the boat, and
the two missionaries seated themselves beside it, attended by the
boatman whose wound they had cured.&nbsp; It was agreed that a
young companion of his should ride the horse across the shallows,
leading the mule, while Samdadchiemba, in like manner, was to
conduct the camels over.&nbsp; When all was ready we started, the
boat following one course, the horses and camels another, for the
latter were obliged to make long circuits in order to avoid the
deeper parts of the river.</p>
<p>The navigation was at first very pleasant.&nbsp; We floated
tranquilly over the broad surface of the waters, in a small
skiff, propelled by a single man with two light sculls.&nbsp; The
pleasure of this water party, amid the deserts of Mongolia, was
not, however, of long duration.&nbsp; The poetry of the thing,
soon at an end, was succeeded by some very doleful prose.&nbsp;
We were advancing gently over the smooth water, vaguely listening
to the measured dips of the sculls, when, all of a sudden, we
were aroused by a clamour behind, of which the shrieks of the
camels constituted a prominent share.&nbsp; We stopped, and,
looking round, perceived that horse, mule, and camels were
struggling in the water, without making any onward
progress.&nbsp; In the general confusion we distinguished
Samdadchiemba flourishing his arms, as if to recall us.&nbsp; Our
<!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>boatman was not at all disposed to accept the
invitation, reluctant as he was to quit the easy current he had
found; but as we insisted, he turned back, and rowed towards the
other party.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba was purple with rage.&nbsp; As soon as we came
up to him, he furiously assailed the boatman with invectives:
&ldquo;Did you want to drown us,&rdquo; bawled he, &ldquo;that
you gave us for a guide a fellow that doesn&rsquo;t know a yard
of the way.&nbsp; Here are we amid gulfs, of which none of us
know the depth or extent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The animals, in fact,
would neither advance nor recede; beat them as you might, there
they remained immovable.&nbsp; The boatman hurled maledictions at
his partner: &ldquo;If you did not know the way, what did you
come for?&nbsp; The only thing to be done now is to go back to
the hut, and tell your cousin to get on the horse; he&rsquo;ll be
a better guide than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To return for a better guide was clearly the safest course,
but this was no easy matter; the animals had got so frightened at
finding themselves surrounded with such a body of water, that
they would not stir.&nbsp; The young guide was at his wits end;
it was in vain that he beat the horse, and pulled the bridle this
way and that; the horse struggled and splashed up the water, and
that was all; not an inch would it move, one way or the
other.&nbsp; The young man, no better horseman than guide, at
last lost his balance and fell into the water; he disappeared for
a moment, to our increased consternation, and then rose at a
little distance, just where he could stand and have his head
above water.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba grew furious, but at last,
seeing no other alternative, he quietly took off all his clothes
as he sat on the camel, threw them into the boat, and slipped
down the camel&rsquo;s side into the stream.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
that man into your boat,&rdquo; cried he to our boatman;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing more to do with him.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go back and find some one who can guide us
properly.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then made his way back through the
water, which sometimes rose up to his neck, leading the animals,
whose confidence returned when they saw themselves preceded by
the Dchiahour.</p>
<p>Our hearts were filled with gratitude at observing the
devotion and courage of this young neophyte, who, for our sakes,
had not hesitated to plunge into the water which, at that season,
was bitterly cold.&nbsp; We anxiously followed him with our eyes
until we saw him close upon the shore.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may
now,&rdquo; said the boatman, &ldquo;be quite at your ease; he
will find in my hut a man who will guide him, so as to avoid the
least danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We proceeded on our way, but the navigation was by no means so
agreeable as before; the boatman could not find again the clear
path on the waters which he was pursuing when we returned to <!--
page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>aid Samdadchiemba; and hampered with aquatic plants,
the vessel made but very slow progress.&nbsp; We tried to mend
matters, by turning to the right and then to the left, but the
difficulty only grew greater; the water was so shallow that the
boat, in its laboured advance, turned up the mud.&nbsp; We were
compelled ourselves to take the sculls, while the boatman,
getting into the water and passing across his shoulders a rope,
the other end of which was tied to the boat, tried to pull us
along.&nbsp; We applied our united efforts to the task of moving
the vessel, but all in vain; it scarcely advanced a foot.&nbsp;
The boatman at last resumed his seat and folded his arms in utter
despair: &ldquo;Since we cannot get on by ourselves,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;we must wait here until the passage-boat comes up, and
then follow in its course.&rdquo;&nbsp; We waited.</p>
<p>The boatman was evidently altogether disconcerted; he loudly
reproached himself for having undertaken this laborious business;
while we, on our parts, were angry with ourselves for having
permitted a consideration of economy to deter us from proceeding
with the ferry-boat.&nbsp; We should have got into the water and
waded to the shore, but, besides the difficulty connected with
the baggage, the undertaking was dangerous in itself.&nbsp; The
ground was so irregular that, while at one moment you passed
through water so shallow that it would scarcely float the boat,
in the next moment you came to a hole, deep enough to drown you
three times over.</p>
<p>It was near noon when we saw three passage-boats passing us,
which belonged to the family who enjoyed the monopoly of the
ferry.&nbsp; After having, with infinite labour, extricated
ourselves from the mud and attained the channel indicated by
these boats, we were quietly following their course when they
stopped, evidently awaiting us.&nbsp; We recognised the person
with whom we had tried to bargain for our passage over, and he
recognised us, as we could easily perceive by the angry glances
which he directed against us.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
tortoise-egg,&rdquo; cried he to our boatman, &ldquo;what have
these western men given you for the passage?&nbsp; They must have
handed over a good bagful of sapeks to have induced you to
trespass upon my rights!&nbsp; You and I will have a little talk
about the matter, by-and-by; be sure of that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer him,&rdquo; whispered the boatman to
us; then raising his voice and assuming an air of virtuous
indignation, he cried to the ferryman: &ldquo;What do you
mean?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
about.&nbsp; Consult the dictates of reason, instead of getting
into a fury about nothing.&nbsp; These Lamas have not given me a
sapek; they have cured my leg with one of their western
specifics, and do you mean to say that in gratitude for such a
benefit I am not to carry them over the Paga-Gol?&nbsp; My
conduct is perfectly right, and in conformity with <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ferryman grumbling between
his teeth, pretended to accept the statement thus made.</p>
<p>This little altercation was succeeded by profound silence on
both sides.&nbsp; While the flotilla was peaceably advancing,
pursuing the thread of a narrow current, just wide enough to
admit the passage of a boat, we saw galloping towards us, along
the shallows, a horseman whose rapid progress dashed aside the
water in all directions.&nbsp; As soon as he came within call he
stopped short: &ldquo;Make haste,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;make
haste; lose no time, row with all your might! The Prime Minister
of the King of the Ortous is yonder on the prairie with his
suite, waiting the arrival of your boat.&nbsp; Row
quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp; He who spoke was a Tartar Mandarin, his
rank being indicated by the blue button which surmounted his hair
cap.&nbsp; After issuing his orders he turned round, whipped his
horse, and galloped back the same way he had come.&nbsp; When he
was out of sight, the murmurs which his presence had restrained
burst out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s labour marked
out!&nbsp; A fine thing, truly, to be employed by a Mongol
Toudzelaktsi (Minister of State), who&rsquo;ll make us row all
day, and then not give us a single sapek for our
pains.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As to that, it need not so much
matter; but the chances are that this Tcheou-ta-dze will break
every bone in our bodies into the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, row away, it can&rsquo;t be helped; after all, we
shall have the honour of ferrying over a
Toudzelaktsi.&rdquo;&nbsp; This little piece of insolence excited
a laugh, but the prevalent expression was that of furious
invective against the Mongol authorities.</p>
<p>Our boatman remained silent; at last he said to us;
&ldquo;This is a most unfortunate day for me.&nbsp; I shall be
obliged to carry some of this Toudzelaktsi&rsquo;s suite perhaps
to Tchagan-Kouren itself.&nbsp; I am by myself, I am ill, and my
boat ought this evening to be engaged in fishing.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
were truly afflicted at this unlucky turn of affairs, feeling as
we did that we were the involuntary occasion of the poor
fisherman&rsquo;s misfortune.&nbsp; We knew very well that it was
no trifling matter to be called into the service, in this way, of
a Chinese or Tartar Mandarin, for whom every thing must be done
at once, unhesitatingly and cheerfully.&nbsp; No matter what may
be the difficulties in the way, that which the Mandarin desires
must be done.&nbsp; Knowing the consequences of the meeting to
our poor boatman, we determined to see what we could do to
relieve him from the dilemma.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said
we, &ldquo;do not be uneasy; the Mandarin who awaits the passage
boats is a Tartar, the minister of the king of this
country.&nbsp; We will endeavour to manage matters for you.&nbsp;
Go very slowly, stop now and then; while we are in your boat no
one, attendants, Mandarins, not even the Toudzelaktsi himself
will venture to say a word to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>We
stopped short in our course, and meanwhile the three
passage-boats reached the landing-place where the Mongol
authorities were waiting for them.&nbsp; Soon two Mandarins, with
the blue button, galloped towards us; &ldquo;What are you
stopping there for?&rdquo; cried they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you
not come on?&rdquo;&nbsp; We interposed: &ldquo;Brother
Mongols,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;request your master to content
himself with the three boats already at the shore.&nbsp; This man
is ill, and has been rowing a long time; it would be cruel to
prevent him from resting himself awhile.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
it as you desire, Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; replied the horsemen, and
they galloped back to the Toudzelaktsi.</p>
<p>We then resumed our course, but very slowly, in order to give
time for every person to embark before we reached the
shore.&nbsp; By-and-by, we saw the three ferry-boats returning,
filled with Mandarins and their attendants; the horses were
fording the river in another direction, under the guidance of one
of the boatmen.&nbsp; As the party approached, our boatman grew
more and more afraid; he did not venture to raise his eyes, and
he scarcely breathed.&nbsp; At last the boats were level with
each other; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; cried a voice, &ldquo;is
peace with you?&rdquo;&nbsp; The red button in the cap of the
speaker, and the richness of his embroidered dress, indicated
that it was the prime minister who addressed to us this Tartar
compliment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Toudzelaktsi of the Ortous,&rdquo;
replied we, &ldquo;our progress is slow, but it is favourable;
may peace also attend you.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a few other
civilities, required by Tartar forms, we proceeded on our
way.&nbsp; When we had attained a safe distance from the
Mandarins, our boatman was perfectly relieved; we had extricated
him from a most serious difficulty.&nbsp; The ferry-boats, it was
probable, would be engaged at least three days in their
gratuitous labour, for the Toudzelaktsi not choosing to travel
across the marshes, the boats would have to convey him down the
Yellow River all the way to Tchagan-Kouren.</p>
<p>After a long, laborious, and dangerous passage, we reached the
other side of the waters.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba had arrived long
before us, and was awaiting us on the margin of the stream.&nbsp;
He was still naked, as to clothes, but then he was covered well
nigh up to the shoulders with a thick layer of mud, which gave
him a negro aspect.&nbsp; In consequence of the extreme
shallowness of the water, the boat could not get within thirty
feet of the shore.&nbsp; The boatmen who preceded us had been
obliged to carry the Mandarins and their attendants on their
shoulders to the boats.&nbsp; We did not choose to adopt the same
process, but rather to make use of the animals for our
disembarkation.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba accordingly brought them
close to the boat; M. Gabet got on the horse, M. Huc on the mule,
and so we reached the shore, without having occasion to employ
any person&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>The sun was just about to set.&nbsp; We would willingly
have encamped at once, for we were exhausted with hunger and
fatigue, but we could not possibly do so, for we had, they told
us, fully two lis to journey before we should get out of the
mud.&nbsp; We loaded our camels, therefore, and proceeded onward,
completing the miserable day in pain and suffering.&nbsp; Night
had closed in before we came to a place where we could set up our
tent; we had no strength left for preparing the usual meal, so
drinking some cold water, and eating a few handfuls of millet, we
lay down, after a brief prayer, and fell into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>The sun was already very high when we rose.&nbsp; On leaving
the tent we looked round us, in order to get acquainted with this
new country, which the darkness of the preceding evening had not
allowed us to examine.&nbsp; It appeared to us dismal and arid;
but we were happy, on any terms, to lose sight of bogs and
swamps.&nbsp; We had left behind us the Yellow River, with its
overflowing waters, and entered the sandy steppes of Ortous.</p>
<p>The land of Ortous is divided into seven banners; it extends a
hundred leagues from east to west, and seventy from south to
north.&nbsp; It is surrounded by the Yellow River on the west,
east, and north, and by the Great Wall on the south.&nbsp; This
country has been subjected, at all periods, to the influence of
the political revolutions, by which the Chinese empire has been
agitated.&nbsp; The <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Chinese and Tartar conquerors have
taken possession of it in turns, and made it the theatre of
sanguinary wars.&nbsp; During the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
centuries, it remained under the sceptre of the kings of Hia, who
derived their origin from the Thou-Pa Tartars of the land of
Si-Fan.&nbsp; The capital of their kingdom, called Hia-Tcheou,
was situated at the foot of the Al&eacute;cha mountains between
the Hoang-Ho and the Great Wall.&nbsp; At present, this town is
called Ning-Hia, and belongs to the province Kan-Sou.&nbsp; In
1227 the kingdom of Hia, and afterwards Ortous, were involved in
the common desolation by the victories of Tchingghis-Khan,
founder of the Tartar dynasty of the Youen.</p>
<p>After the expulsion of the Tartar Mongols by the Ming, the
Ortous fell under the power of the Khan of the Tchakar.&nbsp;
When the latter submitted to the Mantchou conquerors in 1635, the
Ortous followed his example, and were reunited to the empire as a
tributary people.</p>
<p>The Emperor Khang-Hi resided for some time among the Ortous in
1696, when he was on his expedition against the Eleuts; and this
is what he wrote of this people in a letter to the prince, his
son, who had remained at Peking:&mdash;&ldquo;Till now, I never
had at all an accurate idea respecting the Ortous: they are a
very civilised nation, and have lost nothing of the old manners
of the true Mongols.&nbsp; All their princes live in perfect
union among themselves, and do not know the difference between
<i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i>.&nbsp; No one ever heard of a thief
amongst them, although they take not the slightest precaution for
guarding their camels and horses.&nbsp; If by chance one of these
animals goes astray, it is taken care of by him who finds it,
till he has discovered its owner, to whom he restores it, without
the least payment.&nbsp; The Ortous are extremely skilful in
breeding cattle; most of their horses are tame and
tractable.&nbsp; The Tchakars, north of the Ortous, enjoy the
reputation of training them with more care and success;
nevertheless, I believe that the Ortous excel them in this
point.&nbsp; Notwithstanding these advantages, they are not at
all so rich as the other Mongols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This quotation, which we take from the Abb&eacute; Grosier, is
in every point conformable with what we ourselves were able to
observe among the Ortous; so that, since the time of the Emperor
Khang-Hi, this people has not at all changed in its manners.</p>
<p>The aspect of the country through which we travelled on the
first day of our journey seemed affected by the vicinity of the
Chinese fishermen, who reside on the banks of the Yellow
River.&nbsp; We saw here and there cultivated grounds, but there
can be nothing more wretched and bare looking than this
cultivation, except, perhaps, the cultivator himself.&nbsp; These
miserable agriculturists are a <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>mixed
people, half Chinese, half Tartars, but possessing neither the
industry of the former, nor the frank and simple manners of the
latter.&nbsp; They live in houses, or rather in dirty sheds built
of branches intertwined, rudely covered with mud and cow&rsquo;s
excrement.&nbsp; Thirst obliging us to enter one of these
habitations to ask for some water, we were able to convince
ourselves that the interior did not in any way contradict the
misery which appeared outside.&nbsp; Men and animals live
together higgledy-piggledy in these abodes, which are far
inferior to those of the Mongols, where, at least, the air is not
infected by the presence of cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>The sandy soil, which is cultivated by these poor people,
beyond a little buck-wheat and millet, produces only hemp, but
this is very large and abundant.&nbsp; Though, when we were
there, the crop was already gathered in, we could nevertheless
judge of the beauty of its stem from what remained in the
fields.&nbsp; The farmers of Ortous do not pull up the hemp when
it is ripe, as is done in China; they cut it off above the
ground, so high as to leave a stump of about an inch in
diameter.&nbsp; It was accordingly great toil for our camels to
traverse those vast fields of hemp; the stumps, occurring at
every step beneath their large feet, compelled them to execute
all sorts of fantastic movements, which would have excited our
mirth, had we not been fearful of seeing them wounded.&nbsp;
However, that which so impeded our camels proved of great use to
ourselves.&nbsp; When we had set up our tent, these stumps
furnished us with a ready and abundant fuel.</p>
<p>We soon entered once more the Land of Grass, if, indeed, one
can give this name to such a barren, arid country as that of the
Ortous.&nbsp; Wherever you turn you find only a soil, bare, and
without verdure; rocky ravines, marly hills, and plains covered
with a fine, moving sand, blown by the impetuous winds in every
direction; for pasture, you will only find a few thorny bushes
and poor fern, dusty and fetid.&nbsp; At intervals only, this
horrible soil produces some thin, sharp grass, so firm in the
earth, that the animals can only get it up by digging the sand
with their muzzles.&nbsp; The numerous swamps, which had been so
heavy a desolation to us on the borders of the Yellow River,
became matter of regret in the country of the Ortous, so very
rare here is water; not a single rivulet is there, not a spring,
where the traveller can quench his thirst; at distances only are
there ponds and cisterns, filled with a fetid, muddy water.</p>
<p>The Lamas, with whom we had been in communication at Blue
Town, had warned us of all the miseries we should have to endure
in the country of the Ortous, especially on account of the
scarcity of water.&nbsp; By their advice we had bought two wooden
pails, which <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>proved indeed of the greatest
service to us.&nbsp; Whenever we were lucky enough to find on our
way pools or wells dug by the Tartars, we filled our pails,
without considering too nicely the quality of the water, which we
used with the greatest economy, as if it had been some rare and
precious beverage.&nbsp; In spite of all these precautions, it
happened more than once that we were obliged to pass whole days
without getting a single drop of water wherewith to moisten our
lips.&nbsp; But our personal privations were trifling compared
with the pain we felt at seeing our animals wanting water almost
every day in a country where they had nothing to eat beyond a few
plants nearly dried up, and, as it were, calcined by nitre, and
where they accordingly fell away visibly.&nbsp; After some
days&rsquo; travelling, the horse assumed a truly wretched
appearance; it bent down its head, and seemed, at every step, as
though it would sink down with weakness; the camels painfully
balanced themselves on their long legs, and their emaciated humps
hung over their backs like empty bags.</p>

<img class='floatleft' alt=

"The Steppes of Ortous"
src="images/p168.jpg" />
</a>The steppes of the Ortous, though so destitute of water and
good pasture, have not been quite abandoned by wild
animals.&nbsp; You often find there grey squirrels, agile yellow
goats, and beautifully plumaged pheasants.&nbsp; Hares are in
abundance, and are so far from shy, that they did not even take
the trouble to move at our approach; they merely rose on their
hind legs, pricked up their ears, and looked at us as we passed
with the utmost indifference.&nbsp; The fact is, these animals
feel perfectly secure, for, with the <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>exception
of a few Mongols who follow the chase, nobody ever molests
them.</p>
<p>The herds of the Tartars of the Ortous are not very numerous,
and are quite different from those which feed on the rich
pastures of the Tchakar, or of Gechekten.&nbsp; The cattle and
horses appeared very miserable; the goats, sheep, and camels,
however, looked very well, which is undoubtedly the consequence
of their predilection for plants impregnated with saltpetre,
whereas cattle and horses prefer fresh pastures, and pure and
abundant water.</p>
<p>The Mongols of Ortous are very much affected by the
wretchedness of the soil upon which they live.&nbsp; In the
course of our journey we saw no indication that they had become
much richer than they were in the time of the Emperor
Khang-Hi.&nbsp; Most of them live in tents made of some rags of
felt, or of goat-skins framed on a wretched woodwork.&nbsp;
Everything about these tents is so old and dirty, so tattered
with time and storms, that you would with difficulty suppose they
could serve as abodes for human beings.&nbsp; Whenever we
happened to pitch our tent near these poor habitations, we were
sure to be visited by a crowd of wretches who prostrated
themselves at our feet, rolled on the earth, and gave us the most
magnificent titles, in order to extract something from our
charity.&nbsp; We were not rich, but we could not abstain from
bestowing upon them a part of the modicum which the goodness of
Providence had bestowed upon us.&nbsp; We gave them some leaves
of tea, a handful of oatmeal, some broiled millet, sometimes some
mutton fat.&nbsp; Alas! we would fain have given more, but we
were obliged to give according to our means.&nbsp; The
missionaries are themselves poor men, who only live upon the alms
distributed among them every year by their brothers in
Europe.</p>
<p>Any one not acquainted with the laws by which the Tartars are
ruled, would not readily understand why men condemn themselves to
spend their lives in the wretched country of the Ortous, whilst
Mongolia presents, in every direction, immense uninhabited
plains, where water and pasture are to be found in
abundance.&nbsp; Although the Tartars are nomads, and incessantly
wandering about from one place to another, they are,
nevertheless, not at liberty to live in any other country than
their own.&nbsp; They are bound to remain in their own kingdom,
under the dominion of their own sovereign, for slavery is still
maintained among the Mongol tribes with the utmost rigour.&nbsp;
In order to attain an accurate idea of the degree of liberty
these people enjoy in their desert regions, it is expedient to
enter into some details as to the form of their government.</p>
<p>Mongolia is divided into several sovereignties, whose chiefs
are subject to the Emperor of China, himself a Tartar, but of the
<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Mantchou race: these chiefs bear titles corresponding
to those of kings, dukes, earls, barons, etc.&nbsp; They govern
their states according to their own pleasure, none having any
right to meddle with their affairs.&nbsp; They acknowledge as
sovereign only the Emperor of China.&nbsp; Whenever there arise
differences among them, they appeal to Peking.&nbsp; Instead of
levelling lances at each other, as used to be done in the middle
age of Europe, among its little sovereigns, so warlike and so
turbulent, they always submit with respect to the decision of the
Court of Peking, whatever it may be.&nbsp; Though the Mongol
sovereigns think it their duty to prostrate themselves, once a
year, before the Son of Heaven, Lord of the Earth, they
nevertheless do not concede to the Grand-Khan the right of
dethroning the reigning families in the Tartar
principalities.&nbsp; He may, they say, cashier a king for grave
misconduct, but he is bound to fill up the vacant place with one
of the superseded prince&rsquo;s sons.&nbsp; The sovereignty
belongs, they contend, to such and such a family, by a right
which is inalienable, and of which it were a crime to dispossess
the owner.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the King of Barains <a
name="citation170"></a><a href="#footnote170"
class="citation">[170]</a> was accused at Peking of having
conspired a rebellion against the Emperor; he was tried by the
Supreme Tribunal without being heard, and condemned to be
&ldquo;shortened at both ends,&rdquo; the meaning of the decree
being, that his head and feet should be cut off.&nbsp; The king
made enormous presents to the officials who were sent to
superintend the execution of the imperial edict, and they
contented themselves with cutting off his braid of hair, and the
soles of his boots.&nbsp; They reported at Peking that the order
had been executed, and no more was said about the matter.&nbsp;
The king, however, descended from his throne, and was succeeded
by his son.</p>
<p>Although it is a sort of customary right that power shall
always remain in the same family, it cannot be said that there is
anything precisely fixed in this respect.&nbsp; There can be
nothing more vague and indefinite than the relations between the
Tartar sovereigns and the Grand-Khan or Emperor of China, whose
omnipotent will is above all laws and all customs.&nbsp; In
practice, the Emperor has the right to do whatever he chooses to
do, and the right is never disputed by any person.&nbsp; If
doubtful or disputed cases arise, they are decided by force.</p>
<p>In Tartary, all the families that are in any way related to
the sovereign, form a nobility, or a patrician cast, who are
proprietors of the whole soil.&nbsp; These nobles, called Taitsi,
are distinguished by <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>a blue button surmounting the
cap.&nbsp; It is from among them that the sovereigns of the
different states select their ministers, who are generally three
in number, and called Toutzelaktsi&mdash;that is to say, a man
who assists or lends his aid.&nbsp; This rank gives them the
right of wearing the red button.&nbsp; Below the Toutzelaktsi are
the Touchimel, subaltern officers, who are charged with the
details of government.&nbsp; Lastly, a certain number of
secretaries or interpreters, who must be versed in the Mongol,
Mantchou, and Chinese languages, complete the hierarchy.</p>
<p>In the country of the Khalkhas, to the north of the desert of
Gobi, there is a district entirely occupied by Taitsi, who are
supposed to be descendants of the Mongol dynasty, that was
founded by Tchinggiskhan, and which occupied the imperial throne
from 1260 to 1341.&nbsp; After the revolution, which restored the
national independence of the Chinese, these people sought refuge
among the Khalkhas, obtained, without difficulty, a portion of
their immense territory, and adopted the nomad life, which their
ancestors had led prior to the conquest of China.&nbsp; These
Taitsi live in the greatest independence, liable to no duty,
paying no tribute to any one, and recognising no sovereign.&nbsp;
Their wealth consists in tents and cattle.&nbsp; The country of
the Taitsi is, of all the Mongol regions, that wherein the
patriarchal manners are found to be most accurately preserved,
such as the Bible describes them in the lives of Abraham, Jacob,
and the other pastors of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>The Tartars who do not belong to the royal family, are all
slaves, living in absolute subjection to their masters.&nbsp;
Besides the rents they pay, they are bound to keep their
master&rsquo;s flocks and herds, but they are not forbidden to
breed also cattle on their own account.&nbsp; It would be a
fallacy to imagine that slavery in Tartary is oppressive and
cruel, as amongst some nations; the noble families scarcely
differ from the slave families.&nbsp; In examining the relations
between them, it would be difficult to distinguish the master
from the slave: they live both alike in tents, and both alike
occupy their lives in pasturing their flocks.&nbsp; You will
never find among them luxury and opulence insolently staring in
the face of poverty.&nbsp; When the slave enters his
master&rsquo;s tent, the latter never fails to offer him tea and
milk; they smoke together, and exchange their pipes.&nbsp; Around
the tents the young slaves and the young noblemen romp and
wrestle together without distinction; the stronger throws the
weaker; that is all.&nbsp; You often find families of slaves
becoming proprietors of numerous flocks, and spending their days
in abundance.&nbsp; We met many who were richer than their
masters, a circumstance giving no umbrage to the latter.&nbsp;
What a difference between this slavery and that of Rome, for
instance, where the <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Roman citizen, when he made up the
inventory of his house, classed his slaves as furniture.&nbsp;
With those haughty and cruel masters the slave did not merit even
the name of man; he was called, without ceremony, a domestic
thing, <i>res domestica</i>.&nbsp; Slavery, with the Mongol
Tartars, is even less oppressive, less insulting to humanity,
than the bondage of the middle ages.&nbsp; The Mongol masters
never give to their slaves those humiliating nicknames which were
formerly used to designate serfs; they call them brothers; never
villeins, never scum, never <i>gent taillable et corv&eacute;able
&agrave; merci</i>.</p>
<p>The Tartar nobles have the right of life and death over their
slaves.&nbsp; They may administer justice themselves upon their
bondsmen, even to sentence of death; but this privilege is never
exercised in an arbitrary way.&nbsp; In case a slave has been put
to death, a superior tribunal investigates the action of the
master, and if it be found that he has abused his right, the
innocent blood is revenged.&nbsp; The Lamas who belong to slave
families become free, in some degree, as soon as they enter the
sacerdotal tribe; they are liable neither to rents nor enforced
labour; they are at liberty to quit their country, and ramble
through the world at their pleasure, without anybody having the
right to stay them.</p>
<p>Although the relations between master and slave are generally
full of humanity and good-will, there are nevertheless Tartar
sovereigns who abuse their right, and oppress their people, and
exact exorbitant tributes.&nbsp; We know one who makes use of a
system of oppression that is truly revolting.&nbsp; He selects
from among his flocks the oldest and sickliest cattle, camels,
sheep and goats, and gives them in charge to the rich slaves in
his states, who cannot, of course, object to pasture the cattle
of their sovereign master; but are fain to consider it rather an
honour.&nbsp; After a few years, the king applies for his cattle,
by this time all dead or dying of illness or old age, and selects
from the flocks of his slaves the youngest and strongest; often
even, not content with this, he demands double or treble the
number.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is more
just; for in two or three years my beasts must have multiplied,
and therefore a great number of lambs, colts, calves, and young
camels belong to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slavery, however mitigated and softened, can never be in
harmony with the dignity of man.&nbsp; It has been abolished in
Europe, and we hope will be abolished one day among the Mongol
people.&nbsp; But this great revolution will, as everywhere else,
be operated by the influence of Christianity.&nbsp; It will not
be theory-mongers who will liberate these nomad people.&nbsp; The
work will be the work of the priests of Jesus Christ, of the
preachers of the Holy Gospel, <!-- page 173--><a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>that Divine
Charter, wherein are set forth the true rights of man.&nbsp; So
soon as the missionaries shall have taught the Mongols to say,
&ldquo;Our Father who art in Heaven,&rdquo; slavery will fall in
Tartary, and the tree of liberty will grow beside the cross.</p>
<p>After some days&rsquo; march across the sands of the Ortous,
we noticed on our way a small Lamasery, richly built in a
picturesque and wild situation.&nbsp; We passed on without
stopping.&nbsp; We had advanced a gun-shot from the place, when
we heard behind us the galloping of a horse.&nbsp; On looking
round we saw a Lama following us at full speed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have passed our
<i>Soum&eacute;</i> (Lamasery) without stopping.&nbsp; Are you in
such haste that you cannot repose for a day, and offer your
adorations to our saint?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we are rather
in a hurry; our journey is not of a few days; we are going to the
West.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew very well by your physiognomies
that you were not Mongols, and that you came from the West; but
as you are going so far, you had better prostrate yourselves
before our saint; that will bring you good luck.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We never prostrate ourselves before men; the true creed of
the West forbids that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Our saint is not a
mere man; you do not imagine, perhaps, that in our little
Lamasery we have the happiness to possess a Chaberon, a living
Buddha.&nbsp; It is two years since he deigned to descend from
the holy mountains of Thibet; he is now seven years old.&nbsp; In
one of his former lives he was Grand Lama of a splendid Lamasery
in this vale, which was destroyed, according to the prayer-books,
in the time of the wars of Tching-Kis.&nbsp; The saint having
reappeared a few years since, we have constructed in haste a
small Lamasery.&nbsp; Come, brothers, our saint will hold his
right hand over your heads, and luck will accompany your
steps!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The men who know the Holy Doctrine of
the West, do not believe in all these transmigrations of the
Chaberons.&nbsp; We adore only the Creator of Heaven and earth;
his name is Jehovah.&nbsp; We believe that the child you have
made superior of your Lamasery is destitute of all power.&nbsp;
Men have nothing to hope or to fear from him.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
the Lama heard these words, which he certainly never expected, he
was quite stupified.&nbsp; By degrees his face became animated,
and at last exhibited indignation and anger.&nbsp; He looked at
us several times, then, pulling the bridle of his horse, he
turned short round and left us hastily, muttering between his
teeth some words which we could not exactly hear, but which we
were aware did not constitute a benediction.</p>
<p>The Tartars believe with firm and absolute faith in all these
various transmigrations.&nbsp; They would never allow themselves
to entertain the slightest doubt as to the authenticity of their
Chaberons.&nbsp; These living Buddhas are in large numbers, and
are always placed <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>at the head of the most important
Lamaseries.&nbsp; Sometimes they modestly begin their career in a
small temple, and have only a few disciples; but very soon their
reputation increases around, and the small Lamasery becomes a
place of pilgrimage and devotion.&nbsp; The neighbouring Lamas,
speculating upon the rising fashion, surround it with their
cells; the Lamasery acquires development from year to year, and
becomes at last famous in the land.</p>
<p>The election and enthronization of the living Buddhas are
conducted in so singular a manner as to be well worth
relating.&nbsp; When a Grand Lama has gone, that is to say, is
dead, the circumstance is no occasion of mourning in the
Lamasery.&nbsp; There are no tears, no lamentations, for
everybody knows the Chaberon will very soon reappear.&nbsp; This
apparent death is but the beginning of a new existence, as it
were, one ring more added to the unlimited, uninterrupted chain
of successive lives&mdash;a regular palingenesis.&nbsp; While the
saint is in a state of chrysalis, his disciples are in the
greatest anxiety; for it is their most important affair to
discover the place where their master will resume life.&nbsp; A
rainbow appearing in the air is considered a signal sent to them
by their old Great Lama to aid them in their research.&nbsp;
Everyone thereupon says his prayers, and while the Lamasery which
has lost its Buddha redoubles its fastings and prayers, a troop
of elect proceeds to consult the Tchurtchun or augur, famous for
the knowledge of things hidden from the common herd.&nbsp; He is
informed that on such a day of such a moon the rainbow of the
Chaberon has manifested itself on the sky; it made its appearance
in such a place; it was more or less luminous, and it was visible
so long; then it disappeared amid such and such
circumstances.&nbsp; When the Tchurtchun has received all the
necessary indications, he recites some prayers, opens his books
of divination, and pronounces at last his oracle, while the
Tartars who have come to consult him, listen, kneeling and full
of unction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your Great Lama,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;has reappeared in Thibet, at such a distance from your
Lamasery.&nbsp; You will find him in such a family.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When these poor Mongols have heard this oracle, they return full
of joy to announce the glad tidings to their Lamasery.</p>
<p>It often happens that the disciples of the defunct have no
occasion to trouble themselves at all in order to discover the
new birth-place of their Great Lama.&nbsp; He himself takes the
trouble to initiate them into the secret of his
transformation.&nbsp; As soon as he has effected his
metamorphosis in Thibet, he reveals himself at an age when common
children cannot yet articulate a single word.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
I,&rdquo; he says with the accent of authority; &ldquo;it is I
who am the Great Lama, the living Buddha of such a temple;
conduct me to my ancient Lamasery.&nbsp; I am its immortal
superior.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>wonderful
baby having thus spoken, it is speedily communicated to the Lamas
of the Soum&eacute; indicated, that their Chaberon is born in
such a place, and they are summoned to attend and invite him
home.</p>
<p>In whatever manner the Tartars discover the residence of their
Great Lama, whether by the appearance of the rainbow, or by the
spontaneous revelation of the Chaberon himself, they are always
full of intense joy on the occasion.&nbsp; Soon all is movement
in the tents, and the thousand preparations for a long journey
are made with enthusiasm, for it is almost always in Thibet that
they have to seek their living Buddha, who seldom fails to play
them the trick of transmigrating in some remote and almost
inaccessible country.&nbsp; Everyone contributes his share to the
organisation of the holy journey.&nbsp; If the king of the
country does not place himself at the head of the caravan, he
sends either his own son or one of the most illustrious members
of the royal family.&nbsp; The great Mandarins, or ministers of
the king, consider it their duty and an honour to join the
party.&nbsp; When everything is at last prepared, an auspicious
day is chosen, and the caravan starts.</p>
<p>Sometimes these poor Mongols, after having endured incredible
fatigues in horrible deserts, fall into the hands of the brigands
of the Blue Sea, who strip them from head to foot.&nbsp; If they
do not die of hunger and cold in those dreadful
solitudes&mdash;if they succeed in returning to the place whence
they came&mdash;they commence the preparations for a new
journey.&nbsp; There is nothing capable of discouraging
them.&nbsp; At last, when, by dint of energy and perseverance,
they have contrived to reach the eternal sanctuary, they
prostrate themselves before the child who has been indicated to
them.&nbsp; The young Chaberon, however, is not saluted and
proclaimed Great Lama without a previous examination.&nbsp; There
is held a solemn sitting, at which the new living Buddha is
examined publicly, with a scrupulous attention.&nbsp; He is asked
the name of the Lamasery of which he assumes to be the Great
Lama; at what distance it is; what is the number of the Lamas
residing in it.&nbsp; He is interrogated respecting the habits
and customs of the defunct Great Lama, and the principal
circumstances attending his death.&nbsp; After all these
questions, there are placed before him different prayer-books,
articles of furniture, teapots, cups, etc., and amongst all these
things he has to point out those which belonged to his former
life.</p>
<p>Generally this child, at most but five or six years old, comes
forth victorious out of all these trials.&nbsp; He answers
accurately all the questions that are put to him, and makes
without any embarrassment the inventory of his goods.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are the <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>prayer-books I used; there is the japanned porringer
out of which I drank my tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so on.</p>
<p>No doubt the Mongols are often dupes of the fraud of those who
have an interest in making a Great Lama out of this puppet.&nbsp;
Yet we believe that often all this proceeds on both sides with
honesty and good faith.&nbsp; From the information we obtained
from persons worthy of the greatest credit, it appears certain
that all that is said of the Chaberons must not be ranged amongst
illusion and deception.&nbsp; A purely human philosophy will,
undoubtedly, reject such things, or put them, without hesitating,
down to the account of Lama imposture.&nbsp; We Catholic
missionaries believe that the great liar who once deceived our
first parents in the earthly Paradise still pursues his system of
falsehood in the world.&nbsp; He who had the power to hold up in
the air Simon Magus may well at this day speak to mankind by the
mouth of an infant, in order to maintain the faith of his
adorers.</p>
<p>When the titles of the living Buddha have been confirmed, he
is conducted in triumph to the Lamasery, of which he is to be the
Grand Lama.&nbsp; Upon the road he takes, all is excitement, all
is movement.&nbsp; The Tartars assemble in large crowds to
prostrate themselves on his way, and to present to him their
offerings.&nbsp; As soon as he is arrived at his Lamasery, he is
placed upon the altar; and then, kings, princes, mandarins,
Lamas, Tartars, from the richest to the poorest, come and bend
the head before this child, which has been brought from the
depths of Thibet, at enormous expense, and whose demoniac
possessions excite every body&rsquo;s respect, admiration, and
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>There is no Tartar kingdom which does not possess, in one of
its Lamaseries of the first class, a living Buddha.&nbsp; Besides
this superior, there is always another Grand Lama, who is
selected from the members of the royal family.&nbsp; The
Thibetian Lama resides in the Lamasery, like a living idol,
receiving every day the adorations of the devout, upon whom in
return he bestows his blessing.&nbsp; Everything which relates to
prayers and liturgical ceremonies, is placed under his immediate
superintendence.&nbsp; The Mongol Grand Lama is charged with the
administration, good order, and executive of the Lamasery; he
governs whilst his colleague is content to reign.&nbsp; The
famous maxim, <i>Le roi r&egrave;gne et ne gouverne pas</i>, is
not, therefore, the grand discovery in politics that some people
imagine.&nbsp; People pretend to invent a new system, and merely
plunder, without saying a word about it, the old constitution of
the Tartar Lamaseries.</p>
<p>Below these two sovereigns, are several subaltern officers,
who direct the details of the administration, the revenues, the
sales, the purchases, and the discipline.&nbsp; The scribes keep
the registers, and <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>draw up the regulations and orders
which the governor Lama promulgates for the good keeping and
order of the Lamasery.&nbsp; These scribes are generally well
versed in the Mongol, Thibetian, and sometimes in the Chinese and
Mantchou languages.&nbsp; Before they are admitted to this
employment, they are obliged to undergo a very rigorous
examination, in presence of all the Lamas and of the principal
civil authorities, of the country.</p>
<p>After this staff of superiors and officers, the inhabitants of
the Lamasery are divided in Lama-masters and Lama-disciples or
Chabis; each Lama has under his direction one or more Chabis, who
live in his small house, and execute all the details of the
household.&nbsp; If the master possesses cattle, they take charge
of them, milk the cows, and prepare the butter and cream.&nbsp;
In return for these services, the master directs his disciples in
the study of the prayers, and initiates them into the
liturgy.&nbsp; Every morning the Chabi must be up before his
master; his first task is to sweep the chamber, to light a fire
and to make the tea; after that he takes his prayer-book,
presents it respectfully to his master, and prostrates himself
thrice before him, without saying a single word.&nbsp; This sign
of respect is equivalent to a request that the lesson he has to
learn in the course of the day may be marked.&nbsp; The master
opens the book, and reads some pages, according to the capacity
of his scholar, who then makes three more prostrations in sign of
thanks, and returns to his affairs.</p>
<p>The Chabi studies his prayer-book, when he is disposed to do
so, there being no fixed period for that; he may spend his time,
sleeping or romping with the other young pupils, without the
slightest interference on the part of his master.&nbsp; When the
hour for retiring to bed has arrived, he recites the lesson
assigned him in the morning, in a monotonous manner; if the
recitation is good, he is looked upon as having done his duty,
the silence of his master being the only praise he is entitled to
obtain; if, on the contrary, he is not able to give a good
account of his lesson, the severest punishment makes him sensible
of his fault.&nbsp; It often happens, that under such
circumstances, the master, laying aside his usual gravity, rushes
upon his scholar, and overwhelms him at once with blows and
terrible maledictions.&nbsp; Some of the pupils, who are over
maltreated, run away and seek adventures far from their Lamasery;
but in general they patiently submit to the punishment inflicted
on them, even that of passing the night in the open air, without
any clothes and in full winter.&nbsp; We often had opportunities
of talking with Chabis, and when we asked them whether there was
no means of learning the prayers without being beaten, they
ingenuously and with an accent manifesting entire conviction,
replied, that it was impossible.&nbsp; <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>&ldquo;The
prayers one knows best,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;are always those
for which one has got most blows.&nbsp; The Lamas who cannot
recite prayers, or cure maladies, or tell fortunes, or predict
the future, are those who have not been beaten well by their
masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides these studies, which are conducted at home, and under
the immediate superintendence of the master, the Chabis may
attend, in the Lamasery, public lectures, wherein the books which
relate to religion and to medicine are expounded.&nbsp; But these
commentaries are mostly vague, unsatisfactory, and quite
inadequate to form learned Lamas; there are few of them who can
give an exact account of the books they study; to justify their
omission in this respect, they never fail to allege the
profundity of the doctrine.&nbsp; As to the great majority of the
Lamas, they think it more convenient and expeditious to recite
the prayers in a merely mechanical way, without giving themselves
any trouble about the ideas they contain.&nbsp; When we come to
speak of the Lamaseries of Thibet, where the instruction is more
complete than in those of Tartary, we shall enter into some
details upon Lama studies.</p>
<p>The Thibetian books alone being reputed canonical, and
admitted as such by the Buddhist Reformation, the Mongol Lamas
pass their lives in studying a foreign idiom, without troubling
themselves at all about their own language.&nbsp; There are many
of them well versed in the Thibetian literature, who do not even
know their own Mongol alphabet.&nbsp; There are indeed a few
Lamaseries where the study of the Tartarian idiom receives some
slight attention, and where they sometimes recite Mongol prayers,
but these are always a translation of Thibetian books.&nbsp; A
Lama who can read Thibetian and Mongol is reputed quite a
<i>savant</i>; he is thought a being raised above mankind, if he
has some knowledge of Chinese and Mantchou literature.</p>
<p>As we advanced in the Ortous, the country seemed more and more
desert and dismal.&nbsp; To make matters still worse, a terrible
storm, solemnly closing in the autumn season, brought upon us the
cold of winter.</p>
<p>One day, we were proceeding with difficulty through the arid
sandy desert; the perspiration ran down our foreheads, for the
heat was stifling; we felt overpowered by the closeness of the
atmosphere, and our camels, with outstretched necks and mouths
half open, vainly sought in the air a breath of cooling
freshness.&nbsp; Towards noon, dark clouds began to gather in the
horizon; fearful of being surprised by the storm, we determined
to pitch our tent.&nbsp; But where?&nbsp; We looked round on all
sides; we ascended to the tops of the hillocks and anxiously
sought with our eyes for some Tartar habitation, which might
provide us with fuel, but in vain; <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>we had
before us on all sides nothing but a mournful solitude.&nbsp;
From time to time, we saw the foxes retiring to their holes, and
herds of yellow goats running to take repose in the defiles of
the mountains.&nbsp; Meantime, the clouds continued to rise and
the wind began to blow violently.&nbsp; In the irregularity of
its gusts it seemed now to bring us the tempest, now to drive it
from us.&nbsp; While we were thus suspended between hope and
fear, loud claps of thunder, and repeated flashes of lightning,
that seemed to enkindle the sky, gave us notice that we had no
other resource than to place ourselves entirely in the hands of
Providence.&nbsp; The icy north wind blowing fiercely, we
directed our steps to a defile, which opened near us; but before
we had time to reach it the storm exploded.&nbsp; At first, rain
fell in torrents, then hail, and at last snow half melted.&nbsp;
In an instant we were wet through to the skin, and felt the cold
seizing upon our limbs.&nbsp; We immediately alighted, hoping
that walking would warm us a little, but we had hardly advanced
ten steps amidst the deluge of sand, when our legs sank as in
mortar.&nbsp; When we found it impossible to go any further we
sought shelter by the side of our camels, and crouched down,
pressing our arms closely against our sides, in order to attain,
if possible, a little warmth.</p>
<p>While the storm continued to hurl against us its fury, we
awaited with resignation the fate which Providence destined for
us.&nbsp; It was impossible to pitch the tent; it was beyond
human power to spread cloth saturated with rain, and half frozen
by the north wind.&nbsp; Besides it would have been difficult to
find a site for it, since the water streamed in every
direction.&nbsp; Amid circumstances so dreadful, we looked at
each other in sadness and in silence; we felt the natural warmth
of our body diminishing every minute, and our blood beginning to
freeze.&nbsp; We offered, therefore, the sacrifice of our lives
to God, for we were convinced that we should die of cold during
the night.</p>
<p>One of us, however, collecting all his strength and all his
energy, climbed up an eminence, which commanded a view of the
contiguous defile, and discovered a footpath, leading by a
thousand sinuosities into the depths of the immense ravine; he
pursued its direction, and after a few steps in the hollow,
perceived in the sides of the mountain large openings, like
doors.&nbsp; At this sight recovering at once his courage and his
strength, he ascended once more the eminence in order to
communicate the good news to his companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
saved,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;there are caves in this defile;
let us hasten to take refuge in them.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words
immediately aroused the little caravan; we left our animals upon
the hill, and speedily descended into the ravine.&nbsp; A
footpath led to the opening; we advanced our heads, and
discovered in the interior of the mountain, <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>not simple
caves formed by nature, but fine, spacious apartments excavated
by the hand of man.&nbsp; Our first exclamation was an expression
of thankfulness for the goodness of Providence.&nbsp; We selected
the cleanest and largest of these caverns and in an instant
passed from the utmost misery to the height of felicity.&nbsp; It
was like a sudden and unhoped-for transition from death to
life.</p>

</a>On viewing these subterranean dwellings, constructed with so
much elegance and solidity, we were of opinion that some Chinese
families had repaired to this country to cultivate the soil; but
that, repelled by its barrenness, they had given up their
enterprise.&nbsp; Traces of cultivation, which we perceived here
and there, confirmed our conjecture.&nbsp; When the Chinese
establish themselves anywhere in Tartary, if they find mountains,
the earth of which is hard and solid, they excavate caverns in
their sides.&nbsp; These habitations are cheaper than houses, and
less exposed to the irregularity of the seasons.&nbsp; They are
generally very well laid out; on each side of the door there are
windows, giving sufficient light to the interior; the walls, the
ceiling, the furnaces, the kang, everything inside is so coated
with plaster, so firm and shining, that it has the appearance of
stucco.&nbsp; These caves have the advantage of being very <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>warm in winter and very cool in summer; the want of
sufficient air, however, sometimes makes a sojourn in them
dangerous to the health.&nbsp; Those dwellings were no novelty to
us, for they abound in our mission of Si-Wan.&nbsp; However, we
had never seen any so well constructed as these of the
Ortous.</p>
<p>We took possession of one of those subterranean abodes, and
commenced proceedings by making a large fire in the furnaces,
with plentiful bundles of hemp-stems, which we found in one of
the caves.&nbsp; Never, on our journey, had we at our disposal
such excellent fuel.&nbsp; Our clothes dried very soon, and we
were so happy at being in this fine hotel of Providence, that we
spent the greater part of the night enjoying the delightful
sensation of warmth, while Samdadchiemba was never tired of
broiling little cakes in mutton fat.&nbsp; It was altogether
quite a festival with us, and our flour felt somewhat the effects
of it.</p>
<p>The animals were not less happy than we.&nbsp; We found for
them stables out in the mountain, and, which was better still,
excellent forage.&nbsp; One cave was filled with millet stems and
oat-straw.&nbsp; But for this horrible storm, which had nearly
killed us, our animals would never have got so grand a
treat.&nbsp; After having for a long time enjoyed the poetry of
our miraculous position, we yielded to the necessity of taking
repose, and laid down upon a well-warmed kang, which made us
forget the terrible cold we had endured during the tempest.</p>
<p>Next morning, while Samdadchiemba was using the rest of the
hemp stems, and drying our baggage, we went out for a nearer
inspection of these numerous subterrenes.&nbsp; We had scarcely
gone ten steps, when we beheld, to our great astonishment, whirls
of smoke issuing from the door and windows of a cave adjoining
our own.&nbsp; As we fancied we were alone in the desert, the
sight of this smoke excited a surprise, mingled with fear.&nbsp;
We directed our steps to the opening of the cavern, and, on
reaching the threshold of the door, perceived within a large fire
of hemp stems, whose undulating flame reached the ceiling, so
that the place looked like an oven.&nbsp; On further
investigation we observed a human form moving amidst the thick
smoke; we soon heard the Tartar salute, Mendou! uttered by a
sonorous voice; &ldquo;Come and sit beside this
fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; We did not like to advance.&nbsp; This cave of
Cacus, that loud voice, presented to our minds something
phantastic.&nbsp; Finding that we remained silent and motionless,
the inhabitant of this sort of vent-hole of Erebus, rose and came
to the threshold.&nbsp; He was neither a devil nor a ghost, but
simply a Mongol Tartar, who, the night before, having been
surprised by the storm, had fled to this cave, where he had
passed the night.&nbsp; After a few words about the rain, wind
and hail, we <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>invited him to breakfast with us,
and brought him to our dwelling.&nbsp; While Samdadchiemba, aided
by our guest, made the tea, we went out again to pursue our
researches.</p>
<p>We walked amid these deserted and silent abodes with a
curiosity not free from terror.&nbsp; All were constructed upon
much the same model, and still preserved their pristine
integrity.&nbsp; Chinese characters engraved on the walls, and
pieces of porcelain vases, confirmed our impression that these
caves had been inhabited not long since by Chinese.&nbsp; Some
old woman&rsquo;s shoes, which we discovered in a corner, removed
any remaining doubt.&nbsp; We could not shake off a feeling of
sadness and melancholy, when we thought of those numerous
families, who, after having lived a long time in the entrails of
this large mountain, had gone elsewhere to seek a more hospitable
soil.&nbsp; As we entered the caves, we alarmed flocks of
sparrows, which had not yet left these former dwellings of man,
but had, on the contrary, boldly taken possession of these grand
nests.&nbsp; The millet and oats strewn around profusely, induced
them to remain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;they too will fly away when they no longer find here any
more grains, when they find that the old inhabitants of these
caves return no more, and they will seek hospitality under the
roofs of houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sparrow is a regular cosmopolite; we have found it
wherever we have found man; ever with the same vivid, petulant,
quarrelsome character; ever with the same sharp, angry cry.&nbsp;
It is, however, to be remarked that in Tartary, China, and Thibet
it is, perhaps, more insolent than in Europe; because there,
nobody makes war upon it, and its nest and brood are piously
respected.&nbsp; You see it boldly enter the house, live there on
familiar terms, and peck up at its leisure the remnants of
man&rsquo;s food.&nbsp; The Chinese call it Kio-nio-eul, (bird of
the family).</p>
<p>After having inspected about thirty of these caves, which did
not present anything remarkable, we returned to our own.&nbsp; At
breakfast, the conversation naturally turned upon the Chinese who
had excavated these dwellings.&nbsp; We asked the Tartar if he
had seen them.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have I
seen the Kitats who inhabited this defile?&nbsp; Why, I knew all
of them; it is not more than two years since they left the
country.&nbsp; For that matter,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;they had
no right to remain here; as they were rascals, it was quite
proper to turn them out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rascals, say you?
why, what mischief could they do in this wretched
ravine?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, the Kitats are sly, cheating
fellows.&nbsp; At first, they seemed very good; but that did not
last long.&nbsp; It is more than twenty years ago that a few of
their families sought our hospitality: as they were poor, they
got permission to cultivate some land in the vicinity, on <!--
page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>condition, that every year after harvest they should
furnish some oatmeal to the Taitsi of the country.&nbsp; By
degrees, other families arrived, who also excavated caverns
wherein to dwell; and soon this defile was full of them.&nbsp; In
the beginning, these Kitats showed a gentle, quiet character; we
lived together like brothers.&nbsp; Tell me, Sirs Lamas, is it
not well to live together like brothers?&nbsp; Are not all men
brothers?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, that is true; you speak the
words of justice; but why did these Kitats go hence?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Peace did not last long; they soon showed themselves
wicked and false.&nbsp; Instead of being content with what had
been given them, they extended their cultivation at their
pleasure, and took possession of a large territory, without
asking anyone&rsquo;s leave.&nbsp; When they were rich they would
not pay the oatmeal they had agreed to pay as tribute.&nbsp;
Every year, when we claimed the rent, we were received with
insults and maledictions.&nbsp; But the worst thing was, that
these rascally Kitats turned thieves, and took possession of all
the goats and sheep that lost their way in the sinuosities of the
ravine.&nbsp; At last, a Taitsi of great courage and capacity,
called together the Mongols of the neighbourhood, and
said,&mdash;&lsquo;The Kitats take away our land, they steal our
beasts, and curse us; as they do not act or speak as brothers, we
must expel them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Everybody was pleased with these
words of the old Taitsi.&nbsp; After a deliberation, it was
decided that the principal men of the country should go to the
king, and supplicate an order condemning the Kitats to be
expelled.&nbsp; I was one of the deputation.&nbsp; The king
reproached us for having permitted foreigners to cultivate our
lands; we prostrated ourselves before him, observing profound
silence.&nbsp; However, the king, who always acts with justice,
had the order written, and sealed with his red seal.&nbsp; The
ordonnance said, that the king would not permit the Kitats to
live any longer in the country; and that they must leave it
before the first day of the eighth moon.&nbsp; Three Taitsi rode
off to present the ordonnance to the Kitats.&nbsp; They made no
answer to the three deputies, but said amongst themselves,
&lsquo;The king desires us to go; very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards we learned that they had assembled and had
resolved to disobey the orders of the king and to remain in the
country, in spite of him.&nbsp; The first day of the eighth moon
arrived, and they still occupied calmly their habitations,
without making any preparation for departure.&nbsp; In the
morning, before daybreak, all the Tartars mounted their horses,
armed themselves with their lances, and drove their flocks and
herds upon the cultivated lands of the Kitats, on which the crop
was still standing: when the sun rose, nothing of that crop was
left.&nbsp; All had been devoured by the animals, or trodden
down.&nbsp; The Kitats yelled and cursed us, <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>but the
thing was done.&nbsp; Seeing that their position was desperate,
they collected, the same day, their furniture and agricultural
implements, and went off to settle in the eastern parts of the
Ortous, at some distance from the Yellow River, near the
Paga-Gol.&nbsp; As you came through Tchagan-Kouren, you must have
met on your route, west of the Paga-Gol, Kitats cultivating some
pieces of land; well, it was they who inhabited this defile, and
excavated all these caves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having finished his narrative, the Tartar went out for a
moment and brought back a small packet, which he had left in the
cavern, where he had passed the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs
Lamas,&rdquo; he said on his return, &ldquo;I must depart; but
will you not come and repose for a few days in my dwelling?&nbsp;
My tent is not far hence; it is behind that sandy mountain which
you perceive there towards the north.&nbsp; It is at the utmost
not more than thirty lis off.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are much
obliged to you,&rdquo; answered we.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hospitality
of the Mongols of Ortous is known everywhere, but we have a long
journey before us; we cannot stop on our way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are a few days, sooner or later, in a long
journey?&nbsp; Your beasts cannot always be on their feet; they
need a little rest.&nbsp; You yourselves have had much to endure
from the weather of yesterday.&nbsp; Come with me; all will then
be well.&nbsp; In four days we shall have a festival.&nbsp; My
eldest son is going to establish a family.&nbsp; Come to the
nuptials of my son; your presence will bring him good
fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Tartar, seeing us inflexible, mounted
his horse, and after having ascended the pathway which led to the
defile, disappeared across the heath and sand of the desert.</p>
<p>Under other circumstances, we should have accepted with
pleasure the offer thus made; but we desired to make the shortest
possible stay amongst the Ortous.&nbsp; We were anxious to leave
behind us that miserable country, where our animals were wasting
away daily, and where we had ourselves met with such fatigue and
misery.&nbsp; Besides, a Mongol wedding was no new thing to
us.&nbsp; Since we had entered Tartary, we had witnessed more
than once, ceremonies of that kind.</p>
<p>The Mongols marry very young, and always under the influence
of the absolute authority of the parents.&nbsp; This affair, so
grave and important, is initiated, discussed, and concluded,
without the two persons most interested in it, taking the least
part in it.&nbsp; Whatever promises of marriage may take place in
youth, or at more advanced age, it is the parents who always
settle the contract, without even speaking to their children
about it.&nbsp; The two future consorts do not know, perhaps
never saw each other.&nbsp; It is only when they are married that
they have the opportunity to inquire whether there is sympathy
between their characters or not.</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>The daughter never brings any marriage portion.&nbsp;
On the contrary, the young man has to make presents to the family
of his bride: and the value of these presents is seldom left to
the generosity of the husband&rsquo;s parents.&nbsp; Everything
is arranged beforehand and set forth in a public document, with
the minutest details.&nbsp; In fact, the matter is less a
marriage present than the price of an object, sold by one party
and bought by the other.&nbsp; The thing is indeed very clearly
expressed in their language; they say, &ldquo;I have bought for
my son the daughter of so and so.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have
sold our daughter to such and such a family.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
marriage contract is thus simply a contract of sale.&nbsp; There
are mediators, who bargain and haggle, up and down, till at last
they come to an agreement.&nbsp; When it is settled how many
horses, oxen, sheep, pieces of linen, pounds of butter, what
quantity of brandy and wheat-flour shall be given to the family
of the bride, the contract is at length drawn up before
witnesses, and the daughter becomes the property of the
purchaser.&nbsp; She remains, however, with her family till the
time of the nuptial ceremonies.</p>
<p>When the marriage has been concluded between the mediators,
the father of the bridegroom, accompanied by his nearest
relations, carries the news to the family of the bride.&nbsp; On
entering, they prostrate themselves before the little domestic
altar, and offer to the idol of Buddha a boiled sheep&rsquo;s
head, milk, and a sash of white silk.&nbsp; Then they partake of
a repast provided by the parents of the bridegroom.&nbsp; During
the repast, all the relations of the bride receive a piece of
money, which they deposit in a vase filled with wine made of
fermented milk.&nbsp; The father of the bride drinks the wine,
and keeps the money.&nbsp; This ceremony is called
Tahil-T&eacute;bihou, &ldquo;striking the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day indicated by the Lamas as auspicious for the marriage
having arrived, the bridegroom sends early in the morning a
deputation to fetch the girl who has been betrothed to him, or
rather whom he has bought.&nbsp; When the envoys draw near, the
relations and friends of the bride place themselves in a circle
before the door, as if to oppose the departure of the bride, and
then begins a feigned fight, which of course terminates with the
bride being carried off.&nbsp; She is placed on a horse, and
having been thrice led round her paternal house, she is then
taken at full gallop to the tent which has been prepared for the
purpose, near the dwelling of her father-in-law.&nbsp; Meantime,
all the Tartars of the neighbourhood, the relations and friends
of both families, repair to the wedding-feast, and offer their
presents to the new married pair.&nbsp; The extent of these
presents, which consist of beasts and eatables, is left to the
generosity of the guests.&nbsp; They are destined for the father
of the bridegroom <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>and often fully indemnify him for
his expenses in the purchase of the bride.&nbsp; As the offered
animals come up they are taken into folds ready constructed for
them.&nbsp; At the weddings of rich Tartars, these large folds
receive great herds of oxen, horses and sheep.&nbsp; Generally
the guests are generous enough, for they know that they will be
paid in return, upon a similar occasion.</p>
<p>When the bride has finished dressing, she is introduced to her
father-in-law; and while the assembled Lamas recite the prayers
prescribed by the ritual, she first prostrates herself before the
image of Buddha, then before the hearth, and lastly before the
father, mother, and other near relatives of the bridegroom, who,
on his part, performs the same ceremonies towards the family of
his bride, assembled in an adjacent tent.&nbsp; Then comes the
wedding-feast, which sometimes continues for seven or eight
days.&nbsp; An excessive profusion of fat meat, infinite tobacco,
and large jars of brandy, constitute the splendour and
magnificence of these repasts.&nbsp; Sometimes music is added to
the entertainment, and they invite Toolholos, or Tartar singers,
to give more solemnity to the festival.</p>
<p>The plurality of wives is admitted in Tartary, being opposed
neither to the laws, nor to the religion, nor to the manners of
the country.&nbsp; The first wife is always the mistress of the
household, and the most respected in the family.&nbsp; The other
wives bear the name of little spouses (paga &eacute;me), and owe
obedience and respect to the first.</p>
<p>Polygamy, abolished by the Gospel, and contrary in itself to
the happiness and concord of families, may, perhaps, be regarded
as a blessing to the Tartars.&nbsp; Considering the present state
of society with them, it is, as it were, a barrier opposed to
libertinism and corruption of morals.&nbsp; Celibacy being
imposed on the Lamas, and the class of those who shave the head
and live in lamaseries being so numerous, it is easy to conceive
what disorders would arise from this multiplication of young
women without support and abandoned to themselves, if girls could
not be placed in families in the quality of second wives.</p>
<p>Divorce is very frequent among the Tartars.&nbsp; It takes
place without any participation of the civil or ecclesiastical
authorities.&nbsp; The husband, who repudiates his wife, has not
even occasion for a pretext to justify his conduct.&nbsp; He
sends her back, without any formality, to her parents, and
contents himself with a message that he does not require her any
longer.&nbsp; This proceeding is in accordance with Tartar
manners, and does not offend any one.&nbsp; The husband thinks
himself entitled to the privilege, in consideration of the oxen,
sheep and horses he was obliged to give as nuptial
presents.&nbsp; The parents of the repudiated wife do not
complain at <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>having their daughter back; she
resumes her place in the family till another husband presents
himself, in which case, they even rejoice over the profit they
make by thus selling the same merchandise twice over.</p>
<p>In Tartary, the women lead an independent life enough.&nbsp;
They are far from being oppressed and kept in servitude, as with
other Asiatic nations.&nbsp; They may come and go at their
pleasure, ride out on horseback, and pay each other visits from
tent to tent.&nbsp; Instead of the soft, languishing physiognomy
of the Chinese women, the Tartar woman presents in her bearing
and manners a power and force well in accordance with her active
life and nomad habits, and her attire augments the effect of her
masculine, haughty mien.</p>
<p>Large leather boots, and a long green or violet robe fastened
round the waist by a black or blue girdle, constitutes her dress,
except that sometimes she wears over the great robe a small coat,
resembling in form our waistcoats, but very large, and coming
down to the hips.&nbsp; The hair of the Tartar women is divided
in two tresses, tied up in taffetas, and hanging down upon the
bosom; their luxury consists in ornamenting the girdle and hair
with spangles of gold and silver, pearls, coral, and a thousand
other toys, the form and quality of which it would be difficult
for us to define, as we had neither opportunity, nor taste, nor
patience to pay serious attention to these futilities.</p>

<p>The Tartar who had just taken his leave had informed us, that
at a short distance from the caverns we should find in a vale the
finest pasturages in the whole country of the Ortous.&nbsp; We
resolved to depart.&nbsp; It was near noon already when we
started.&nbsp; The sky was clear, the sun brilliant; but the
temperature, still affected by the storm of the preceding day,
was cold and sharp.&nbsp; After having travelled for nearly two
hours over a sandy soil, deeply <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>furrowed by
the streams of rain, we entered, on a sudden, a valley whose
smiling, fertile aspect singularly contrasted with all that we
had hitherto seen among the Ortous.&nbsp; In the centre flowed an
abundant rivulet, whose sources were lost in the sand; and on
both sides, the hills, which rose like an amphitheatre, were
covered with pasturage and clumps of shrubs.</p>
<p>Though it was still early, we gave up all idea of continuing
our journey that day.&nbsp; The place was too beautiful to be
passed by; besides, the north wind had risen, and the air became
intolerably cold.&nbsp; We pitched our tent, therefore, in a
corner, sheltered by the hills.&nbsp; From the interior of the
tent, our view extended, without obstruction, down the valley,
and we were thus enabled to watch our animals without moving.</p>
<p>After sunset, the violence of the wind increased, and the cold
became more and more intense.&nbsp; We thought it advisable to
take some measures of security.&nbsp; Whilst Samdadchiemba piled
up large stones to consolidate the borders of the tent, we went
about the adjacent hills, and made, by aid of a hatchet, an
abundant provision of fuel.&nbsp; As soon as we had taken our tea
and our daily broth, we went to sleep.&nbsp; But sleep did not
last long; the cold became so severe that it soon roused
us.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t remain so,&rdquo; said the
Dchiahour; &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t want to die of cold on our
goatskins, we must get up and make a large fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s words were full of sense; it was not
advisable to sleep at such a time, and accordingly we rose, and
added to our usual dress the great sheepskin robes that we had
bought at Blue Town.</p>
<p>Our fire of roots and green branches was hardly lighted, when
we felt our eyes as it were calcined by the biting acid influence
of a thick smoke, which filled the tent.&nbsp; We opened the
door; but as this gave admission to the wind, without getting rid
of the smoke, we were soon obliged to shut it again.&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba was not in any way molested by the thick smoke,
which stifled us and drew burning tears from our eyes.&nbsp; He
laughed without pity at seeing us crouched by the fire, our heads
bending over our knees, and our faces buried in both hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My spiritual fathers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your eyes are
large and bright, but they cannot endure a little smoke; mine are
small and ugly, but, never mind, they perform their service very
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jests of our camel driver were not much
adapted to cheer us up; we suffered dreadfully.&nbsp; Yet, amid
our tribulations, we saw occasion to feel our happiness to be
very great.&nbsp; We could not reflect without gratitude upon the
goodness of Providence, which had led us to caves, whose great
value we now fully appreciated.&nbsp; If we had not been able to
dry our clothes, if we had been surprised by the cold in the
piteous state in <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>which the storm had left us, we
certainly could not have lived long; we should have been frozen
with our clothes in one immovable block.</p>
<p>We did not think it prudent to proceed amid such severe cold,
and to leave an encampment, where at least our animals got
sufficient herbage to browse upon, and where fuel was
abundant.&nbsp; Towards noon, the weather having grown milder, we
went out to cut wood on the hills.&nbsp; On our way we observed
that our animals had left the pasturage, and collected on the
banks of the rivulet.&nbsp; We at once conceived that they were
tormented by thirst, and that the stream being frozen, they could
not quench it.&nbsp; We bent our steps to them, and found, in
fact, the camels eagerly licking the surface of the ice, while
the horse and the mule were kicking upon it with their hard
hoofs.&nbsp; The hatchet we had brought with us to cut wood,
served to break the ice, and to dig a small pond, where our
animals could quench their thirst.</p>
<p>Towards evening, the cold having resumed its intensity, we
adopted a plan for enabling us to obtain a better sleep than we
had in the preceding night.&nbsp; Until morning, the time was
divided into three watches, and each of us was charged, in turns,
with keeping up a large fire in the tent, while the others
slept.&nbsp; Thus we did not feel much of the cold, and slept in
peace, without fear of setting our linen house on fire.</p>
<p>After two days of horrible cold the wind abated, and we
resolved to proceed on our way.&nbsp; It was only with great
difficulty that we got down our tent.&nbsp; The first nail that
we tried to draw out, broke like glass under the hammer.&nbsp;
The sandy, humid soil on which we had made our encampment, was so
frozen that the nails stuck in it as if they had been incrusted
in stone.&nbsp; To uproot them, we were obliged to wet them
several times with boiling water.</p>
<p>At the time of our departure, the temperature was so mild that
we were fain to take off out skin coats, and to pack them up
until further occasion.&nbsp; Nothing is more frequent in Tartary
than these sudden changes of temperature.&nbsp; Sometimes the
mildest weather is abruptly followed by the most horrible
frost.&nbsp; All that is needed for this is the falling of snow,
and the subsequent rise of the north wind.&nbsp; Any one not
inured to these sudden changes of the atmosphere, and not
provided, in travelling, with well-furred robes, is often exposed
to dreadful accidents.&nbsp; In the north of Mongolia especially,
it is not unusual to find travellers frozen to death amidst the
desert.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day of the new moon, we came upon numerous
caravans, following, like ourselves, the direction from east to
west.&nbsp; The road was filled with men, women, and children,
riding on camels or oxen.&nbsp; They were all repairing, they
said, to the <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin.&nbsp;
When they had asked whether our journey had the same object, they
were surprised at receiving an answer in the negative.&nbsp;
These numerous pilgrims, the astonishment they showed upon
hearing that we were not going to the Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin,
excited our curiosity.&nbsp; At the turn of a defile, we overtook
an old Lama, who, laden with a heavy pack, seemed to make his way
with great labour and pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;you are old; your black hairs are not so numerous as the
grey.&nbsp; Doubtless your fatigue must be extreme.&nbsp; Place
your burden upon one of our camels; that will relieve you a
little.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon hearing these words the old man
prostrated himself before us, in order to express his
gratitude.&nbsp; We made a camel kneel, and Samdadchiemba added
to our baggage that of the Lama.&nbsp; So soon as the pilgrim was
relieved from the weight which had oppressed him, his walk became
more elastic, and an expression of satisfaction was diffused over
his countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;we
are from the West, and the affairs of your country not being well
known to us, we are astonished at finding so many pilgrims here
in the desert.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are all going to
Rache-Tchurin,&rdquo; replied he, in accents full of
emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;some
grand solemnity calls you together?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
to-morrow will be a great day: a Lama Bokt&egrave; will manifest
his power: kill himself, yet not die.&rdquo;&nbsp; We at once
understood what solemnity it was that thus attracted the
Ortous-Tartars.&nbsp; A Lama was to cut himself open, take out
his entrails and place them before him, and then resume his
previous condition.&nbsp; This spectacle, so cruel and
disgusting, is very common in the Lamaseries of Tartary.&nbsp;
The Bokt&egrave; who is to manifest his power, as the Mongols
phrase it, prepares himself for the formidable operation by many
days fasting and prayer, pending which, he must abstain from all
communication whatever with mankind, and observe the most
absolute silence.&nbsp; When the appointed day is come, the
multitude of pilgrims assemble in the great court of the
Lamasery, where an altar is raised in front of the
Temple-gate.&nbsp; At length the Bokt&egrave; appears.&nbsp; He
advances gravely, amid the acclamations of the crowd, seats
himself upon the altar, and takes from his girdle a large knife
which he places upon his knees.&nbsp; At his feet, numerous
Lamas, ranged in a circle, commence the terrible invocations of
this frightful ceremony.&nbsp; As the recitation of the prayers
proceeds, you see the Bokt&egrave; trembling in every limb, and
gradually working himself up into phrenetic convulsions.&nbsp;
The Lamas themselves become excited: their voices are raised;
their song observes no order, and at last becomes a mere
confusion of yelling and outcry.&nbsp; Then the Bokt&egrave;
suddenly throws aside the scarf which envelopes him, unfastens
his girdle, and seizing the sacred knife, slits open his stomach,
in one long cut.&nbsp; <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>While the
blood flows in every direction, the multitude prostrate
themselves before the terrible spectacle, and the enthusiast is
interrogated about all sorts of hidden things, as to future
events, as to the destiny of certain personages.&nbsp; The
replies of the Bokt&egrave; to all these questions are regarded,
by everybody, as oracles.</p>
<p>When the devout curiosity of the numerous pilgrims is
satisfied, the Lamas resume, but now calmly and gravely, the
recitation of their prayers.&nbsp; The Bokt&egrave; takes, in his
right hand, blood from his wound, raises it to his mouth,
breathes thrice upon it, and then throws it into the air, with
loud cries.&nbsp; He next passes his hand rapidly over his wound,
closes it, and everything after a while resumes its pristine
condition, no trace remaining of the diabolical operation, except
extreme prostration.&nbsp; The Bokt&egrave; once more rolls his
scarf round him, recites in a low voice, a short prayer; then all
is over, and the multitude disperse, with the exception of a few
of the especially devout, who remain to contemplate and to adore
the blood-stained altar which the Saint has quitted.</p>
<p>These horrible ceremonies are of frequent occurrence in the
great Lamaseries of Tartary and Thibet, and we do not believe
that there is any trick or deception about them; for from all we
have seen and heard, among idolatrous nations, we are persuaded
that the devil has a great deal to do with the matter; and
moreover, our impression that there is no trick in the operation
is fortified by the opinion of the most intelligent and most
upright Buddhists whom we have met in the numerous Lamaseries we
visited.</p>
<p>It is not every Lama that can perform miraculous
operations.&nbsp; Those who have the fearful power to cut
themselves open, for example, are never found in the higher ranks
of the Lama hierarchy.&nbsp; They are generally lay Lamas of
indifferent character, and little esteemed by their
comrades.&nbsp; The regular Lamas generally make no scruple to
avow their horror of the spectacle.&nbsp; In their eyes, all
these operations are wicked and diabolical.&nbsp; Good Lamas,
they say, are incapable of performing such acts, and should not
even desire to attain the impious talent.</p>
<p>Though these demoniac operations are, in general, decried in
well-regulated Lamaseries, yet the superiors do not prohibit
them.&nbsp; On the contrary, there are certain days in the year
set apart for the disgusting spectacle.&nbsp; Interest is,
doubtless, the only motive which could induce the Grand Lamas to
favour actions which in their conscience they reprove.&nbsp; The
fact is, that these diabolical displays are an infallible means
of collecting together a swarm of stupid and ignorant devotees,
who communicate renown to the Lamasery, and enrich it with the
numerous offerings which the Tartars never fail to bring with
them on such occasions.</p>
<p><!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>Cutting open the abdomen is one of the most famous
<i>si&eacute;-fa</i> (supernaturalisms) possessed by the
Lamas.&nbsp; There are others of the same class, less imposing,
but more common; these are practised in people&rsquo;s houses,
privately, and not at the great solemnities of the
Lamaseries.&nbsp; For example, they heat irons red-hot, and then
lick them with impunity; they make incisions in various parts of
the body, which an instant afterwards leave no trace behind,
etc.&nbsp; All these operations have to be preceded by the
recitation of some prayer.</p>
<p>We knew a Lama who, according to every one&rsquo;s belief,
could fill a vase with water, by the mere agency of a prayer; but
we could never induce him to try the experiment in our
presence.&nbsp; He told us that as we held not the same faith
with him, the experiment, in our company, would not be merely
fruitless, but would expose him to serious danger.&nbsp; One day,
however, he recited to us the prayer of his si&eacute;-fa.&nbsp;
It was brief, but we readily recognised in it a direct appeal to
the assistance of the demon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know thee, thou
knowest me;&rdquo; thus it ran: &ldquo;Come old friend, do what I
ask of thee.&nbsp; Bring water, and fill the vase I hold out to
thee.&nbsp; To fill a vase with water, what is that to thy vast
power!&nbsp; I know thou chargest dear for a vase of water; but
never mind: do what I ask of thee, and fill the vase I present to
thee.&nbsp; Some time hence we&rsquo;ll come to a reckoning: on
the appointed day thou shalt receive thy due.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
sometimes happens that the appeal remains without effect: in such
cases, praying is discontinued, and the being invoked is assailed
with insults and imprecations.</p>
<p>The famous si&eacute;-fa that was now attracting so large a
number of pilgrims to the Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin, inspired us
with the idea of repairing thither also, and of neutralizing, by
our prayers, the satanic invocations of the Lamas.&nbsp; Who
knows, said we to each other, who knows but that God even now has
designs of mercy towards the Mongols of the Ortous land; perhaps
the sight of their Lama&rsquo;s power, fettered and overcome by
the presence of the priests of Jesus Christ, will strike upon the
hearts of these people, and make them renounce the lying creed of
Buddha, and embrace the faith of Christianity!&nbsp; To encourage
each other in this design, we dwelt upon the history of Simon
Magus, arrested in his flight by the prayer of St. Peter, and
precipitated from the air to the feet of his admirers.&nbsp; Of
course, poor missionaries, such as we, had not the insane
pretension to compare ourselves with the prince of the Apostles;
but we knew that the protection of God, which is sometimes
granted in virtue of the merit and sanctity of him who seeks it,
is also often accorded to the omnipotent effacity in prayer
itself.</p>
<p>We resolved, therefore, to go to Rache-Tchurin, to mingle with
the crowd, and, at the moment when the diabolical invocations
<!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>should commence, to place ourselves, fearlessly, and
with an air of authority before the Bokt&egrave;, and to solemnly
forbid him, in the name of Jesus Christ, to make a display of his
detestable power.&nbsp; We did not disguise from ourselves the
possible results of this proceeding; we knew that it would
assuredly excite the fury and hatred of the adorers of Buddha;
and that perhaps a violent death would be an instant reward for
the endeavour to convert these Tartars; &ldquo;But what
matter!&rdquo; exclaimed we; &ldquo;let us do courageously our
work as missionaries; let us employ fearlessly the power that we
have received from on high, and leave to Providence the care of a
future which does not appertain to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were our intentions and our hopes; but the views of God
are not always in conformity with the designs of man, even when
these appear most in harmony with the plan of His
Providence.&nbsp; That very day there happened to us an accident
which, carrying us far away from Rache-Tchurin, involved us in
the most distressing perplexities.</p>
<p>In the evening, the old Lama who was travelling with us asked
us to make the camel kneel, so that he might take his pack from
its back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;are we not
going to journey together to the Lamasery of
Rache-Tchurin?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No; I must follow the path
which you see meandering towards the north, along those
hills.&nbsp; Behind that sand-hill is a trading place, where,
upon festival days, a few Chinese merchants set up their tents
and sell goods.&nbsp; As I want to make a few purchases, I cannot
continue to walk in your shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can we buy
flour at the Chinese encampment?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Millet,
oatmeal, flour, beef, mutton, tea-bricks, everything is sold
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not having been able to purchase provisions
since our departure from Tchagan-Kouren, we considered this a
favourable opportunity for supplying our deficiency in this
respect.&nbsp; In order not to fatigue our beasts of burden with
a long circuit across stony hills, M. Gabet took the flour-sacks
upon his camel, separated from the caravan, and went off at a
gallop towards the Chinese post.&nbsp; According to the
indications furnished by the old Lama, he was to meet us again in
a valley at no great distance from the Lamasery.</p>
<p>After travelling for nearly an hour along a rugged road,
continually intersected by pits and quagmires, the Missionary
Purveyor reached the small heath, on which he found a number of
Chinese encamped, some of their tents serving as shops, and the
rest as dwellings.&nbsp; The encampment presented the appearance
of a small town full of trade and activity, the customers being
the Lamas of Rache-Tchurin and the Mongol pilgrims.&nbsp; M.
Gabet speedily effected his purchases; and having filled his
sacks with flour, and hung two magnificent sheep&rsquo;s&rsquo;
livers over one of the camel&rsquo;s humps, <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>rode off to
the place where it had been arranged the caravan should await
him.&nbsp; He soon reached the spot, but he found no person
there, and no trace of man or beast having recently passed was
visible on the sand.&nbsp; Imagining that perhaps some
derangement of the camels&rsquo; loads had delayed our progress,
he turned into the road, which it had been agreed we should
follow; but it was to no purpose that he hastened along it, that
he galloped here and there, that he ascended every hill he came
to,&mdash;he could see nothing; and the cries he uttered to
attract our attention remained unanswered.&nbsp; He visited
several points where various roads met, but he found merely
another confusion of the steps of horses, camels, oxen, sheep,
tending in every direction, and crossing and recrossing each
other, so that he was left, at last, without even a
conjecture.</p>
<p>By-and-by be recalled to mind that our aim, as last resolved,
had been the Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin; he turned round, and
perceiving the Lamasery in the distance, hurried thither as fast
as he could go.&nbsp; When he reached the structure, which stood
in the form of an amphitheatre upon the slope of a hill, he
looked every where for us, and asked everybody about us, for
here, at least, there was no lack of persons from whom to seek
information, and our little caravan was composed in a manner
likely to attract the attention of those who saw it at all: two
laden camels, a white horse, and, above all, a black mule, that
everyone we passed stopped to remark, on account of its extreme
diminutiveness, and the splendid tint of its skin.&nbsp; M. Gabet
inquired and inquired, but to no purpose; no one had seen our
caravan.&nbsp; He ascended to the summit of the hill, whence the
eye extended over a large expanse, but he could see nothing at
all like us.</p>
<p>The sun set, yet the caravan did not appear.&nbsp; M. Gabet
beginning to fear that some serious accident had befallen it,
once more set off, and searched in every direction, up hill and
down dale, but he could see nothing of us, and learn nothing of
us, from the travellers whom he met.</p>
<p>The night advanced, and soon the Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin
disappeared in the darkness.&nbsp; M. Gabet found himself alone
in the desert, without path and without shelter, fearing alike to
advance or to recede, lest he should fall into some abyss.&nbsp;
He was fain, therefore, to stop where he was, in a narrow, sandy
defile, and to pass the night there.&nbsp; By way of supper, he
had to content himself with an <i>Impression de Voyage</i>.&nbsp;
Not that provisions were wanting, by any means, but fire was, and
water.&nbsp; Besides, the feeling of hunger was superseded by the
anxieties which afflicted his heart as to the caravan.&nbsp; He
knelt on the sand, said his evening prayer, and then lay down his
head upon one of the flour-sacks beside the <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>camel,
keeping its bridle round his arm lest the animal should stray
during the night.&nbsp; It is needless to add that his sleep was
neither sound nor continuous; the cold, bare ground is not a very
eligible bed, especially for a man preyed upon by dark
anxieties.</p>
<p>With the earliest dawn, M. Gabet mounted his camel, and though
well nigh exhausted with hunger and fatigue, proceeded anew in
search of his companions.</p>
<p>The caravan was not lost, though it was terribly astray.&nbsp;
After M. Gabet had quitted us, in order to visit the Chinese
post, we at first exactly followed the right path; but before
long we entered upon a vast steppe, all trace of road insensibly
faded away amidst sand so fine that the slightest wind made it
undulate like sea-waves; there was no vestige upon it of the
travellers who had preceded us.&nbsp; By-and-by the road
disappeared altogether, and we found ourselves environed with
yellow hills, which presented not the slightest suggestion even
of vegetation.&nbsp; M. Huc, fearing to lose himself amid these
sands, stopped the cameleer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Samdadchiemba,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;do not let us proceed at random.&nbsp; You see
yonder, in the valley, that Tartar horseman driving a herd of
oxen; go and ask him the way to Rache-Tchurin.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba raised his head, and looked for a moment, closing
one eye, at the sun, which was veiled with some passing
clouds.&nbsp; &ldquo;My spiritual father,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I am accustomed to wander about the desert; my opinion is,
that we are quite in the right road: let us continue our course
westward, and we cannot go astray.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
well, since you think you know the desert, keep on.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, yes; don&rsquo;t be afraid.&nbsp; You see that long,
white line on the mountain yonder? that&rsquo;s the road, after
its issue from the sands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s assurance, we continued to advance in
the same direction.&nbsp; We soon came to a road as he had
promised, but it was a road disused, upon which we could see no
person to confirm or contradict the assertion of Samdadchiemba,
who persisted that we were on the way to Rache-Tchurin.&nbsp; The
sun set, and the twilight gradually gave place to the darkness of
night, without our discovering the least indication of the
Lamasery, or, which surprised us still more, of M. Gabet, who,
according to the information of the old Lama, ought to have
rejoined us long ago.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba was silent, for he now
saw that we had lost our way.</p>
<p>It was important to encamp before the night had altogether
closed in.&nbsp; Perceiving a well at the end of a hollow, we set
up our tent beside it.&nbsp; By the time our linen-house was in
order, and the baggage piled, the night had completely set in;
yet M. Gabet had not appeared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get on a
camel,&rdquo; said M. Huc to Samdadchiemba, &ldquo;and look about
for M. Gabet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Dchiahour made no reply; <!-- page
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>he
was thoroughly disconcerted and depressed.&nbsp; Driving a stake
into the ground, he fastened one of the camels to it, and
mounting upon the other, departed mournfully in quest of our
friend.&nbsp; He had scarcely got out of sight, when the camel
that was left behind, finding itself alone, sent forth the most
frightful cries; by-and-by it became furious; it turned round and
round the stake, backed to the very limit of the rope and of its
long neck, made longer by painful extension, and applied every
effort to get rid of the wooden curl that was passed through its
nose: the spectacle of its struggle was really frightful.&nbsp;
At last it succeeded in breaking the cord, and then dashed off
boundingly into the desert.&nbsp; The horse and mule had also
disappeared; they were hungry and thirsty; and about the tent
there was not a blade of grass, not a drop of water.&nbsp; The
well beside which we had encamped was perfectly dry; in fact, it
was nothing more than an old cistern which had probably been for
years useless.</p>
<p>Thus our little caravan, which for nearly two months had
journeyed, without once separating, through the desert plains of
Tartary, was now utterly dispersed; man and beast&mdash;all had
disappeared.&nbsp; There remained only M. Huc, solitary in his
little linen-house, and a prey to the most corroding
anxieties.&nbsp; For a whole day he had neither eaten nor drunk;
but under such circumstances you do not ordinarily feel either
hunger or thirst; the mind is too full to give any place to the
suggestions of the body; you seem environed with a thousand
fearful phantoms: and great indeed were your desolation, but that
you have for your safety and your consolation, prayer, the sole
lever that can raise from off your heart the weight of sombre
apprehensions that would otherwise crush it.</p>
<p>The hours passed on, and no one returned.&nbsp; As, in the
obscurity of night, persons might pass quite close to the tent,
and yet not see it, M. Huc, from time to time, ascended the
adjacent hills and rocks, and, in his loudest tones, called out
the names of his lost companions, but no one replied; all still
was silence, and solitude.&nbsp; It was near midnight, when at
length the plaintive cries of a camel, apparently remonstrating
against being driven so fast, were heard in the distance.&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba soon came up.&nbsp; He had met several Tartar
horsemen who had no tidings, indeed, of M. Gabet, but from whom
he learned that we had gone altogether astray; that the road we
were pursuing led to a Mongol encampment, in precisely the
contrary direction to Rache-Tchurin.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
day-break,&rdquo; said Samdadchiemba, &ldquo;we must raise the
tent, and find the right path; we shall there, no doubt, meet the
elder spiritual father.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Samdadchiemba, your
advice is a bubble; the tent and the baggage must remain here,
for the excellent reason, that they cannot <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>be moved
without animals.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Animals!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Dchiahour, &ldquo;where, then, is the camel I fastened to the
stake?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It broke the rope and ran away; the
horse and the mule have run away too, and I have not the least
idea where any of them are to be sought.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is a pretty business,&rdquo; grumbled the cameleer;
&ldquo;however, when day breaks we must see what can be
done.&nbsp; Meanwhile, let us make a little tea.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Make tea, by all means, if you can make tea without water,
but water there is none; the well is perfectly dry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This announcement completed the discomfiture of poor
Samdadchiemba; he sank back quite exhausted upon the baggage, and
his weariness soon threw him into deep slumber.</p>
<p>With the first streaks of dawn, M. Huc ascended an adjacent
hill in the hope of discovering something or somebody.&nbsp; He
perceived, in a distant valley, two animals, one black, one
white; he hastened to them, and found our horse and mule browsing
on some thin, dusty grass, beside a cistern of soft water.&nbsp;
When he led the animals back to the tent, the sun was about to
rise, but Samdadchiemba still slumbered, lying in exactly the
same position which he had assumed when he went to sleep.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Samdadchiemba,&rdquo; cried M. Huc, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you
have some tea this morning?&rdquo;&nbsp; At the word tea, our
cameleer jumped up as though he had been electrified; he looked
round, his eyes still heavy with sleep, &ldquo;Did not the
spiritual father mention tea?&nbsp; Where is the tea?&nbsp; Did I
dream I was going to have some tea?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether you dreamed it, but tea you may have, if
you wish, as there is soft water in the valley yonder, where,
just now, I found the horse and the mule.&nbsp; Do you go and
fetch some water, while I light the fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba joyfully adopted the proposition, and putting the
buckets over his shoulders, hastened to the cistern.</p>
<p>When tea was ready, Samdadchiemba became quite comfortable; he
was absorbed with his beloved beverage, and seemed to have
altogether forgotten the disruption of the caravan.&nbsp; It was
necessary, however, to recall the circumstance to him, in order
that he might go in search of the camel that had run away.</p>
<p>Nearly one half the day elapsed, yet his companions did not
rejoin M. Huc.&nbsp; From time to time there passed Tartar
horsemen or pilgrims returning from the festival of
Rache-Tchurin.&nbsp; Of these M. Huc inquired whether they had
not seen, in the vicinity of the Lamasery, a Lama dressed in a
yellow robe and a red jacket, and mounted on a red camel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lama,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is very tall, with a
great grey beard, a long pointed nose, and a red
face.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this description, there was a general
answer in the negative: &ldquo;Had we seen such a
personage,&rdquo; said the travellers, &ldquo;we should certainly
have remarked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>At length, M. Gabet appeared on the slope of a hill;
from its summit he had recognised our blue tent pitched in the
valley, and he galloped towards his recovered companion as fast
as his camel could go.&nbsp; After a brief, animated
conversation, wherein both spoke and neither answered, we burst
into a hearty laugh at the misadventure thus happily
terminated.&nbsp; The reorganization of the caravan was completed
before sunset, by Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s return with the missing
camel, which, after a long round, he had found fastened to a
tent; the Tartar, who owned the tent, having seen the animal
running away, had caught it and secured it until some one should
claim it.</p>
<p>Though the day was far advanced, we determined to remove, for
the place where we had encamped was miserable beyond all
expression.&nbsp; Not a blade of grass was to be seen, and the
water I had discovered was at so great a distance, that it
involved quite a journey to fetch it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;if we can only, before
night, manage to get within sight of the right road, it will be a
great point gained.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our departure thus determined,
we sat down to tea.&nbsp; The conversation naturally turned upon
the vexatious mischance which had given us so much fatigue and
trouble.&nbsp; Already more than once, on our journey, the
intractable, obstinate temperament of Samdadchiemba had been the
occasion of our losing our way.&nbsp; Mounted on his little mule,
as we have described, it was he who led the caravan, preceding
the beasts of burden.&nbsp; Upon his assumption that he
thoroughly understood the four cardinal points, and that he was
perfectly conversant with the deserts of Mongolia, he would never
condescend to inquire the route from persons whom he met, and we
not unfrequently suffered from his self opinion.&nbsp; We were
resolved, therefore, to convert the accident which had just
befallen us, into the basis of a warning to our guide.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Samdadchiemba,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;listen with
attention to the important advice we are about to impart.&nbsp;
Though in your youth you may have travelled a good deal in
Mongolia, it does not follow that you are master of all the
routes; distrust, therefore, your own conjectures, and be more
willing to consult the Tartars whom we meet.&nbsp; If yesterday,
for example, you had asked the way, if you had not persisted in
your practice of being guided wholly by the course of the sun, we
should not have endured so much misery.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba made no reply.</p>
<p>We then got up to make the preparations for departure.&nbsp;
When we had put in order the different articles that had been
confusedly thrown about the tent, we remarked that the Dchiahour
was not occupied, as usual, in saddling the camels.&nbsp; We went
to see what he was about, and to our great surprise found him
tranquilly seated <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>upon a large stone behind the
tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed we, &ldquo;has it not
been determined that we are to encamp elsewhere this
evening?&nbsp; What are you seated on that stone
for?&rdquo;&nbsp; Samdadchiemba made no reply; he did not even
raise his eyes, but kept them fixedly directed towards the
ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Samdadchiemba, what is the matter with
you?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you saddle the camels?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you wish to go,&rdquo; replied he drily, &ldquo;you can
go; as for me, I remain here.&nbsp; I cannot any longer accompany
you.&nbsp; I am, it seems, a wicked man, devoid of conscience;
what occasion can you have for such a person?&rdquo;&nbsp; We
were greatly surprised to hear this from a young neophyte who had
seemed so attached to us.&nbsp; We, however, thought it best to
attempt no persuasion, lest we should aggravate the sullen pride
of his character, and render him still more indocile for the
future.&nbsp; We accordingly proceeded to do the necessary work
ourselves.</p>
<p>We had already folded the tent and packed it on a camel, not a
word being spoken by any of the party.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba
remained seated on the stone, covering his face with his hands,
and probably watching through his fingers how we got on with the
labour which he was accustomed to fulfil.&nbsp; When he saw that
we were doing very well without him, he rose, without uttering a
word, loaded the other camel, saddled his own mule, mounted it,
and led the way as usual.&nbsp; M. Gabet and M. Huc exchanged
smiles, but they said nothing, for they feared that any
observations at that moment might irritate a temperament which
evidently required the greatest care in its management.</p>
<p>We halted in a spot beside the road, not very magnificent,
certainly, as a station, but at all events, infinitely preferable
to the ravine of desolation in which we had experienced such
misery.&nbsp; There was this great blessing, that we were once
more united; an immense satisfaction in the desert, and which we
had never sufficiently appreciated until the occurrence of the
mischance that had for a while separated us.&nbsp; We celebrated
the occasion by a splendid banquet, of which the flour and
sheep&rsquo;s liver, purchased by M. Gabet, formed the
basis.&nbsp; This unaccustomed treat relaxed the frowning brow of
Samdadchiemba, who applied himself to the culinary arrangements
with absolute enthusiasm, and effected, with very limited
resources, a supper of several courses.</p>
<p>Next morning, at daybreak, we were in motion.&nbsp; We had not
proceeded far when we discovered before us, outlined on the
yellow ground of a sandy hill, several large buildings,
surrounded with a multitude of white huts.&nbsp; This was the
Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin, which, as we approached it, seemed to
us a well-built, well-kept place.&nbsp; The three Buddhist
temples which rise from the centre of <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>the
establishment, are of elegant, of majestic construction.&nbsp;
The entrance to the principal temple is through a square tower of
colossal proportions, at each angle of which is a monstrous
dragon, elaborately carved in stone.&nbsp; We traversed the
Lamasery from one end to the other, along the chief
streets.&nbsp; There was throughout religious and solemn
silence.&nbsp; The only persons we saw were a few Lamas enveloped
in their large red scarfs, who, after giving us the salutation of
the day in a tone scarce above a whisper, gravely continued their
melancholy walk.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p201.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=
"Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin"
title=
"Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin"
src="images/p201.jpg" />
</a>Towards the western extremity of the Lamasery,
Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s little mule shied, and then dashed off at a
gallop, followed in its irregular flight, by the two baggage
camels.&nbsp; The animals on which we were mounted were equally
alarmed.&nbsp; All this disorder was occasioned by a young Lama,
who was stretched at full length in the middle of the street,
performing a rite in great vogue among the Buddhists, and which
consists in making the circuit of a Lamasery, prostrating
yourself, with your forehead to the ground, at every single step
you make.&nbsp; Sometimes the number of devotees performing
together this painful pilgrimage is perfectly prodigious; <!--
page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>they follow each other, in Indian file, along a narrow
path which encircles the entire Lamasery and its appendant
buildings.&nbsp; Any one who deviates in the slightest degree
from the prescribed line, is considered to have failed in his
devotion, and loses all the fruit he would otherwise have derived
from his previous toil.&nbsp; Where the Lamasery is of any
extent, the devotees have hard work to get through the ceremony
in the course of a long day; so that the pilgrims, who have
undertaken this exercise, and have started early in the morning,
think themselves lucky if they can complete the operation by
nightfall.&nbsp; For the pilgrimage must be performed without
intermission, so strictly, that the pilgrims are not allowed to
stop for a moment even to take a little nourishment.&nbsp; If,
after commencing the rite you do not complete it offhand, it does
not count; you have acquired no merit, and you are not to expect
any spiritual profit.</p>
<p>Each prostration must be perfect, so that the body shall be
stretched flat along the ground, and the forehead touch the
earth, the arms being spread out before you, and the hands
joined, as if in prayer.&nbsp; Before rising, the pilgrim
describes each time a semi-circle on the ground by means of a
goat&rsquo;s horn, which he holds in either hand, the line being
completed by drawing the arm down to the side.&nbsp; You cannot
but feel infinite compassion when you look upon these wretched
creatures, their face and clothes all covered with dust or
mud.&nbsp; The most inclement weather will not check their
intrepid devotion; they continue their prostrations amid snow and
rain and the most piercing cold.</p>
<p>There are various modes of performing the pilgrimage round a
Lamasery.&nbsp; Some pilgrims do not prostrate themselves at all,
but carry, instead, a load of prayer-books, the exact weight of
which is prescribed them by the Great Lama, and the burden of
which is so oppressive at times that you see old men, women, and
children absolutely staggering under it.&nbsp; When, however,
they have successfully completed the circuit, they are deemed to
have recited all the prayers contained in the books they have
carried.&nbsp; Others content themselves with simply walking the
circuit, telling the beads of their long chaplets, or constantly
turning a sort of wheel, placed in the right hand, and which
whirls about with inconceivable rapidity.&nbsp; This instrument
is called Tchu-Kor, (turning prayer.)&nbsp; You see in every
brook a number of these Tchu-Kor, which are turned by the
current, and in their movement are reputed to be praying, night
and day, for the benefit of those who erect them.&nbsp; The
Tartars suspend them over the fire-place, and these in their
movements are supposed to pray for the peace and prosperity of
the whole family, emblemed by the hearth.&nbsp; The <!-- page
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>movement itself is effected by the through draught
occasioned by the openings at the top of the tent.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p203.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=
"Turning Prayers"
title=
"Turning Prayers"
src="images/p203.jpg" />
</a>The Buddhists have another mode of simplifying pilgrimages
and devotional rites.&nbsp; In all the great Lamaseries you find
at short intervals figures in the form of barrels, and turning
upon an axle.&nbsp; The material of these figures is a thick
board, composed of infinite sheets of paper pasted together, and
upon which are written in Thibetian characters the prayers most
reputed throughout the country.&nbsp; Those who have not the
taste, or the zeal, or the strength to carry huge boards of books
on their shoulders, or to prostrate themselves, step after step,
in the dust and mire, or to walk round the Lamasery in
winter&rsquo;s cold or summer&rsquo;s heat, have recourse to the
simple and expeditious medium of the prayer barrel.&nbsp; All
they have to do is to set it in motion; it then turns of itself
for a long time, the devotees drinking, eating, or sleeping,
while the complacent mechanism is turning prayers for them.</p>
<p>One day, on approaching a prayer barrel, we found two Lamas
<!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>quarrelling furiously, and just on the point of coming
to blows, the occasion being the fervour of each for
prayer.&nbsp; One of them having set the prayer automaton in
motion, had quietly returned to his cell.&nbsp; As he was
entering it he turned his head, doubtless to enjoy the spectacle
of the fine prayers he had set to work for himself, but to his
infinite disgust, he saw a colleague stopping his prayers, and
about to turn on the barrel on his own account.&nbsp; Indignant
at this pious fraud, he ran back, and stopped his
competitor&rsquo;s prayers.&nbsp; Thus it went on for some time,
the one turning on, the other stopping the barrel, without a word
said on either side.&nbsp; At last, however, their patience
exhausted, they came to high words; from words they proceeded to
menaces, and it would doubtless have come to a fight, had not an
old Lama, attracted by the uproar, interposed words of peace, and
himself put the automaton in motion for the joint benefit of both
parties.</p>
<p>Besides the pilgrims whose devotion is exercised within or
about the Lamaseries, you find many who have undertaken fearfully
long journeys, which they execute with a prostration at every
step.&nbsp; Sad and lamentable is it to see these unhappy victims
of error enduring, to no purpose, such terrible and painful
labours; one&rsquo;s heart is pierced with grief, and one&rsquo;s
soul impressed with yearning for the day when these poor Tartars
shall consecrate to the service of the true God that religious
energy which they daily waste upon a vain and lying creed.&nbsp;
We had hoped to profit by the solemnities at Rache-Tchurin to
announce the true faith to the Ortous; but such was doubtless not
the will of God, since He had permitted us to lose our way on the
very day which seemed most favourable for our project.&nbsp; We
accordingly passed through the Lamasery of Rache-Tchurin without
stopping, eager as we were to arrive at the very source of that
immense superstition, of which, as yet, we had only witnessed a
few shallow streams.</p>
<p>At a short distance from Rache-Tchurin we reached a road well
marked out, and covered with travellers.&nbsp; It was not,
however, devotion that had set these people in motion, as it had
the pilgrims whom we saw at the Lamasery; mere matter of business
was leading them towards the Dabsoun-Noor, (the Salt Lake,)
celebrated throughout Western Mantchou, and which supplies with
salt, not only the adjacent Tartars, but also several provinces
of the Chinese Empire.</p>
<p>For a day&rsquo;s journey before you reach Dabsoun-Noor the
soil changes by degrees its form and aspect; losing its yellow
tint, it becomes insensibly white, as though thinly covered with
snow.&nbsp; The earth swelling in every direction, forms
innumerable hillocks, cone-shaped, and of a regularity so perfect
that you might suppose <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>them to
have been constructed by the hand of man.&nbsp; Sometimes they
are grouped in heaps, one on the other, like pears piled on a
plate; they are of all sizes, some but just created, others old,
exhausted, and falling to decay.&nbsp; Around these excrescences
grow creeping thorns, long-pointed, without flowers or leaves,
which, intertwining spirally, surmount them with a sort of
net-work cap.&nbsp; These thorns are never found elsewhere than
about these hillocks; upon those of more recent growth they are
firm, vigorous, and full of shoots.&nbsp; Upon the elder
elevations they are dried up, calcined by the nitre, brittle, and
in shreds.</p>
<p>As you look upon these numerous mounds, covered with a thick
efflorescence of nitre, it is obvious to your sense that beneath
the surface, and at no great depth, some great chemical operation
is in progress.&nbsp; Springs, generally so rare in the Ortous
country, are here of frequent occurrence, but the water is for
the most part excessively salt.&nbsp; Here and there, however, by
the very side of a brackish pool, there is a spring of soft,
sweet, delicious water; all such are indicated to travellers by a
small flag, fluttering from the end of a long pole.</p>
<p>Dabsoun-Noor is not so much a lake as a reservoir of mineral
salt, mixed with nitrous effloresence.&nbsp; The latter, in
colour pale white, and crumbling between the fingers, is easily
distinguishable from the salt, which is of a grey tint, and
glitters like crystal when broken.&nbsp; Dabsoun-Noor is about
twenty lis in circumference.&nbsp; Around it, at intervals, are
the tents occupied by the Mongols who work it, and the Chinese
who have thrust themselves in as partners.&nbsp; It were
difficult indeed to find any description of industry or commerce
within a certain range of their own country in which the Chinese
do not contrive to have a hand.&nbsp; The manipulation to which
the salt is subjected requires neither great labour nor great
science.&nbsp; All the workers do is to pick it up as it comes in
the reservoir, to pile it, and, when the heap is of a certain
size, to cover it with a thin coating of potter&rsquo;s
earth.&nbsp; When the salt has sufficiently purified itself, the
Tartars convey it to the nearest Chinese mart and exchange it for
tea, tobacco, brandy, and other commodities.&nbsp; In the
locality itself salt is of no value: at every step you see lumps
of it, sometimes of remarkable purity.&nbsp; We filled a bag with
these for our own use and for that of the camels, which are all
very fond of salt.&nbsp; We traversed Dabsoun-Noor throughout its
breadth from east to west, and we had to take the utmost
precaution as we proceeded over its loose, and at times almost
moving, soil.&nbsp; The Tartars recommended us not to deviate in
the least from the path we should find marked out, and by all
means to avoid any places where we should see the water bubbling
up, for there they <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>informed us, were gulfs which they
had frequently endeavoured to sound, but without result.&nbsp;
This statement induced us to believe that there is a noor, or
lake, here, but that it is underground, the place called
Dabsoun-Noor being merely the covering or roof of the lake,
composed of the saline and saltpetrous matter produced by the
constant evaporation of the subterranean waters.&nbsp; Foreign
matter, brought by the wind, and consolidated by the rain, would
in the lapse of time form a crust upon such a roof strong enough
to bear the caravans that incessantly traverse Dabsoun-Noor.</p>
<p>This great salt mine seems to pervade with its influence the
whole Ortous district, throughout whose extent the water is
brackish, the soil arid, and the surface encrusted with saline
matter.&nbsp; This absence of rich pasturage and fresh water is
very adverse to the growth of cattle; but the camel, whose robust
and hardy temperament adapts itself to the most sterile regions,
affords compensation to the Tartars of the Ortous.&nbsp; This
animal, a perfect treasure to the dwellers in the desert, can
remain a fortnight, or even a month, without eating or
drinking.&nbsp; However wretched the land may be on which it is
put to feed, it can always find wherewith to satisfy its hunger,
especially if the soil be impregnated with salt or nitre.&nbsp;
Things that no other animal will touch, to it are welcome; briars
and thorns, dry wood itself, supply it with efficient food.</p>
<p>Though it costs so little to keep, the camel is of an utility
inconceivable to those who are not acquainted with the countries
in which Providence has placed it.&nbsp; Its ordinary load is
from 700 to 800 lbs., and it can carry this load ten leagues a
day.&nbsp; Those, indeed, which are employed to carry dispatches,
are expected to travel eighty leagues per diem, but then they
only carry the dispatch bearer.&nbsp; In several countries of
Tartary the carriages of the kings and princes are drawn by
camels, and sometimes they are harnessed to palanquins; but this
can only be done in the level country.&nbsp; The fleshy nature of
their feet does not permit them to climb mountains, when they
have a carriage or litter of any sort to draw after them.</p>
<p>The training of the young camel is a business requiring great
care and attention.&nbsp; For the first week of its life it can
neither stand nor suck without some helping hand.&nbsp; Its long
neck is then of such excessive flexibility and fragility, that it
runs the risk of dislocating it, unless some one is at hand to
sustain the head while it sucks the teats of its dam.</p>
<p>The camel, born to servitude, seems impressed from its birth,
with a sense of the yoke it is destined to bear through
life.&nbsp; You never see the young camel playing and frolicking
about, as you see kids, colts, and other young animals.&nbsp; It
is always grave, <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>melancholy, and slow in its
movements, which it never hastens, unless under compulsion.&nbsp;
In the night, and often in the day also, it sends forth a
mournful cry, like that of an infant in pain.&nbsp; It seems to
feel that joy or recreation are not within its portion; that its
inevitable career is forced labour and long fastings, until death
shall relieve it.</p>
<p>The maturation of the camel is a long affair.&nbsp; It cannot
carry even a single rider until its third year; and it is not in
full vigour until it is eight years old.&nbsp; Its trainers then
begin to try it with loads, gradually heavier and heavier.&nbsp;
If it can rise with its burden, this is a proof that it can carry
it throughout the journey.&nbsp; When that journey is only of
brief duration, they sometimes load the animal in excess, and
then they aid it to rise by means of bars and levers.&nbsp; The
camel&rsquo;s capacity for labour endures for a long time.&nbsp;
Provided that at certain periods of the year it is allowed a
short holiday for pasturing at its leisure, it will continue its
service for fully fifty years.</p>
<p>Nature has provided the camel with no means of defence against
other animals, unless you may so consider its piercing, prolonged
cry, and its huge, shapeless, ugly frame, which resembles, at a
distance, a heap of ruins.&nbsp; It seldom kicks, and when it
does, it almost as seldom inflicts any injury.&nbsp; Its soft,
fleshy foot cannot wound, or even bruise you; neither can the
camel bite an antagonist.&nbsp; In fact, its only practical means
of defence against man or beast is a sort of vehement sneeze,
wherewith it discharges, from nose and mouth, a mass of filth
against the object which it seeks to intimidate or to annoy.</p>
<p>Yet the entire male camels, <i>bore</i> as the Tartars call
them, (<i>temen</i> being the generic appellation of the animal),
are very formidable during the twelfth moon, which is their
rutting time.&nbsp; At this period, their eyes are inflamed; an
oily, fetid humour exhales from their heads; their mouths are
constantly foaming; and they eat and drink absolutely nothing
whatever.&nbsp; In this state of excitement they rush at whatever
presents itself, man or beast, with a fierceness of precipitation
which it is impossible to avoid or to resist; and when they have
overthrown the object they have pursued, they pound it beneath
the weight of their bodies.&nbsp; The epoch passed, the camel
resumes its ordinary gentleness, and the routine of its laborious
career.</p>
<p>The females do not produce young until their sixth or seventh
year; the period of gestation is fourteen months.&nbsp; The
Tartars geld most of their male camels, which, by this operation,
acquire a greater development of strength, height, and
size.&nbsp; Their voices become at the same time thinner and
lower, in some instances <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>wholly
lost; and the hair is shorter and finer than that of the entire
camels.</p>
<p>The awkward aspect of the camel, the excessive stench of its
breath, its heavy, ungraceful movements, its projecting
hare-lips, the callosities which disfigure various parts of its
body, all contribute to render its appearance repulsive; yet its
extreme gentleness and docility, and the services it renders to
man, render it of pre-eminent utility, and make us forget its
deformity.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the apparent softness of its feet, the camel
can walk upon the most rugged ground, upon sharp flints, or
thorns, or roots of trees, without wounding itself.&nbsp; Yet, if
too long a journey is continuously imposed upon it, if after a
certain march you do not give it a few days&rsquo; rest, the
outer skin wears off, the flesh is bared, and the blood
flows.&nbsp; Under such distressing circumstances, the Tartars
make sheep-skin shoes for it, but this assistance is unavailing
without rest; for if you attempt to compel the camel to proceed,
it lies down, and you are compelled either to remain with or to
abandon it.</p>
<p>There is nothing which the camel so dreads as wet, marshy
ground.&nbsp; The instant it places its feet upon anything like
mud, it slips and slides, and, generally, after staggering about
like a drunken man, falls heavily on its sides.</p>
<p>When about to repose, it kneels down, folds its fore legs
symmetrically under its body, and stretches out its long neck
before it on the ground.&nbsp; In this position, it looks just
like a monstrous snail.</p>
<p>Every year, towards the close of spring, the camel sheds its
hair, every individual bristle of which disappears before a
single sprout of the new stock comes up.&nbsp; For twenty days
the animal remains completely bare, as though it had been closely
shaved all over, from the top of the head to the extremity of the
tail.&nbsp; At this juncture, it is excessively sensitive to cold
or wet; and you see it, at the slightest chillness in the air or
the least drop of rain, shivering and shaking in every limb, like
a man without clothes exposed on the snow.&nbsp; By degrees the
new hair shows itself, in the form of fine, soft, curling wool,
which gradually becomes a long, thick fur, capable of resisting
the extremest inclemency of the weather.&nbsp; The greatest
delight of the animal is to walk in the teeth of the north wind,
or to stand motionless on the summit of a bill, beaten by the
storm and inhaling the icy wind.&nbsp; Some naturalists say that
the camel cannot exist in cold countries; these writers must have
wholly forgotten the Tartarian camels, which, on the contrary,
cannot endure the least heat, and which certainly could not exist
in Arabia.</p>
<p><!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>The hair of an ordinary camel weighs about ten
pounds.&nbsp; It is sometimes finer than silk, and always longer
than sheep&rsquo;s wool.&nbsp; The hair growing below the neck
and on the legs of the entire camels is rough, bushy, and in
colour black, whereas that of the ordinary camel is red, grey,
and white.&nbsp; The Tartars make no sort of use of it.&nbsp; In
the places where the animals pasture, you see great sheets of it,
looking like dirty rags, driven about by the wind, until they are
collected in sheltered corners, in the hill sides.&nbsp; The
utmost use the Tartars make of it is to twist some of it into
cord, or into a sort of canvas, of which they construct sacks and
carpets.</p>
<p>The milk of the camel is excellent, and supplies large
quantities of butter and cheese.&nbsp; The flesh is hard,
unsavoury, and little esteemed by the Tartars.&nbsp; They use the
hump, however, which, cut into slices, and dissolved in tea,
serves the purpose of butter.&nbsp; It is known that Heliogabalus
had camel&rsquo;s flesh served up at his banquets, and that he
was very fond of camel&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; We cannot speak as to
the latter dish, which the Roman Emperor piqued himself upon
having invented, but we can distinctly affirm that camel&rsquo;s
flesh is detestable.</p>

<p>The environs of the Dabsoun-Noor abound in flocks of goats and
sheep.&nbsp; These animals like to browse on the furze and thorny
bushes, the sole vegetation of these barren steppes; they
especially delight in those nitrous efflorescences which are
found here on all sides in the utmost abundance.&nbsp; The soil,
miserable as it is in other respects, seems very favourable to
the growth of these animals, which enter largely into the
consumption of the Tartars, constituting indeed the basis of
their food.&nbsp; If bought on the spot, they are of very
moderate price.&nbsp; As we calculated that a pound of meat would
cost us less than a pound of flour, we resolved, as a matter of
economy, to buy a sheep.&nbsp; The thing was not difficult to
find; but as it would of <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>course
oblige us to stop, at least for a day, we waited till we should
come to some place, not quite barren, and where our animals could
find some pasturage to browse upon.</p>
<p>Two days after crossing Dabsoun-Noor, we entered a long narrow
valley, where some Mongol families had stationed
themselves.&nbsp; The earth was covered with a close herb, which,
in form and character, had much resemblance to thyme.&nbsp; Our
beasts, as they proceeded, browsed furtively, right and left, on
this plant, and seemed to be very fond of it.&nbsp; This new
pasturage gave us the idea of encamping on the spot.&nbsp; Not
far from a tent, a Lama was sitting on a hillock, making ropes
with camel&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said we as
we approached him, &ldquo;the flock upon that hill doubtless
belongs to you.&nbsp; Will you sell us a sheep?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I will let you have
an excellent sheep; as to the price, we shall not quarrel about
that.&nbsp; We men of prayer are not like merchants.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He indicated to us a spot near his own tent, and unloaded our
beasts.&nbsp; The entire family of the Lama, when they heard the
cries of our camels, hastened to assist us to encamp.&nbsp; We,
indeed, were not allowed to do anything to it; for our new
friends took delight in making themselves useful, in unsaddling
the beasts, pitching the tent, and putting our baggage in order
within.</p>
<p>The young Lama, who had received us with so much kindness,
after having unsaddled the horse and the mule, perceived that
both these beasts were hurt a little on the back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is a bad business;
and as you are upon a long journey, it must be remedied, or you
will not be able to go on.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he took the
knife, which hung from his girdle, sharpened it with rapidity
upon his boot-tops, took our saddles to pieces, examined the
rough parts of the wood, and pared them away on both sides till
he had removed the slightest unevenness.&nbsp; He then put
together again, with wonderful skill, all the pieces of the
saddles, and returned them to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will
do,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;now you may travel in
peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; This operation was effected rapidly and in
the readiest manner possible.&nbsp; The Lama was then about to
fetch the sheep; but as it was already late, we said it was
unnecessary, for that we should remain a whole day in his
valley.</p>
<p>Next morning, before we were awake, the Lama opened the door
of our tent, laughing so loud that he aroused us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I see plainly that you do not
intend to depart to-day.&nbsp; The sun is already very high, and
you sleep still.&rdquo;&nbsp; We rose quickly, and as soon as we
were dressed, the Lama spoke of the sheep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to
the flock,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you may choose at your
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, go by yourself, and select a
sheep for us yourself.&nbsp; At present we have an
occupation.&nbsp; With us, Lamas of the Western sky, it is <!--
page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>a rule to pray as soon as we rise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, what a fine thing!&rdquo; said the Lama; &ldquo;oh,
the holy rules of the West!&rdquo;&nbsp; His admiration, however,
did not make him forget his little affair of business.&nbsp; He
mounted his horse and rode towards a flock of sheep which we saw
undulating upon the slope of a hill.</p>
<p>We had not yet finished our prayers when we heard the Tartar
returning at full gallop.&nbsp; He had fastened the sheep to the
back of his saddle, like a portmanteau.&nbsp; Hardly arrived at
the door of our tent, he dismounted; and in the twinkling of an
eye he had put upon its four legs the poor sheep, quite astounded
at the ride it had been favoured with.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the
sheep; is it not fine?&nbsp; Does it suit you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Admirably.&nbsp; What is the price?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;One ounce; is that too much?&rdquo;&nbsp; Considering the
size of the animal, we thought the price moderate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You ask an ounce; here is an ingot, which is just of the
weight you require.&nbsp; Sit down for a moment; we will fetch
our scales, and you shall ascertain whether this piece of silver
really weighs an ounce.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these words the Lama drew
back, and cried, stretching out both hands towards us:
&ldquo;Above there is a heaven, below there is the earth, and
Buddha is the lord of all things.&nbsp; He wills that men behave
towards each other like brothers; you are of the West, I am of
the East.&nbsp; Is that any reason why the intercourse between us
should not be frank and honourable?&nbsp; You have not cheapened
my sheep: I take your money without weighing it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;An excellent principle,&rdquo; said we.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
you will not weigh the money, pray sit, nevertheless, for a
moment; we will take a cup of tea together and talk over a little
matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what you mean; neither you nor
I may cause the transmigration of this living being.&nbsp; We
must find a layman who knows how to kill sheep.&nbsp; Is it not
so?&rdquo; and without awaiting an answer, he added,
&ldquo;another thing; from your appearance, one may easily guess
that, you are no great hands at cutting up sheep and preparing
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not mistaken,&rdquo; we
answered, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, keep the sheep tied to
your tent; and for the rest, rely upon me; I shall he back in a
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; He mounted his horse, went off at full
gallop and disappeared in a bend of the vale.</p>
<p>According to his promise, the Lama soon returned.&nbsp; He
went straight to his tent, tied his horse to a post, took off his
saddle, bridle and halter, gave it a cut with his whip, and so
sent it off to pasture.&nbsp; He went into his tent for a little
while, and then appeared with all the members of his family, that
is to say, his old mother and two younger brothers.&nbsp; They
advanced slowly towards our tent, in truly ridiculous fashion,
just as if they were going to remove all their furniture.&nbsp;
The Lama carried on his head a large pot, which covered him as
with an enormous hat.&nbsp; His mother had <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>on her back
a large basket, filled with argols.&nbsp; The two young Mongols
followed with a trivet, an iron spoon, and several other minor
kitchen implements.&nbsp; At this sight, Samdadchiemba was full
of joy, for he saw before him a whole day of poetry.</p>
<p>When the entire <i>batterie de cuisine</i> was arranged in
open air, the Lama invited us, in his politeness, to go and
repose in our tent for awhile.&nbsp; He judged from our air, that
we could not, without derogation, be present at the approaching
scene of butchering.&nbsp; The suggestion, however, did not meet
our views, and we requested that if we could do so without
inconveniencing them, we might sit down on the grass at a
respectful distance, and with the promise that we would not touch
anything.&nbsp; After some objections, perceiving that we were
curious to be spectators, they dispensed with the etiquette of
the matter.</p>
<p>The Lama seemed anxious; he kept looking towards the north of
the valley, as if expecting some one.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; he said at last, with an air of satisfaction,
&ldquo;here he comes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who comes?&nbsp; Of
whom do you speak?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I forgot to tell you that
I had been just now to invite a layman to come, who is very
skilful in killing a sheep.&nbsp; There he is.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
rose and perceived, indeed, something moving among the heath of
the valley.&nbsp; At first we could not clearly distinguish what
it was, for though it advanced with some rapidity, the object did
not seem to enlarge.&nbsp; At last the most singular person we
had ever met with in our lives presented himself to our
view.&nbsp; We were obliged to make the utmost efforts to repress
the strong impulse to laughter that came upon us.&nbsp; This
layman seemed to be about fifty years old, but his height did not
exceed three feet.&nbsp; On the top of his head, which terminated
like a sugar-loaf, rose a small tuft of badly combed hair; a
grey, thin beard descended in disorder down his chin.&nbsp;
Finally, two prominences, one on his back, the other on his
breast, communicated to this little butcher a perfect resemblance
with &AElig;sop, as he appears in various editions of the
&ldquo;Fables de la Fontaine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strong sonorous voice of the layman was in singular
contrast with the exiguity of his thin, stunted frame.&nbsp; He
did not lose much time in saluting the company.&nbsp; After
having darted his small black eyes at the sheep, which was tied
to one of the nails of our tent, he said &ldquo;Is this the beast
you wish to have put in order?&rdquo;&nbsp; And while feeling its
tail in order to judge its fat, he gave it a turn, and placed it
on its back with remarkable dexterity.&nbsp; He next tied
together its legs; then, while uncovering his right arm by
throwing back the sleeve of his leathern coat, he asked whether
the operation was to be effected in the tent or outside?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Outside,&rdquo; said we.&nbsp; &ldquo;Outside, very well,
outside;&rdquo; so saying, he drew from a leathern <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>sheath, suspended from his sash, a knife with a large
handle, but whose blade by long use had become thin and
narrow.&nbsp; After having examined for a moment its point with
his thumb, he plunged it to the hilt into the side of the sheep,
and drawing it out quite red, the sheep was dead, dead at once,
without making any movement; not a single drop of blood had
spouted from the wound.&nbsp; We were greatly astonished at this,
and asked the little man how he managed to kill a sheep so very
easily and quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We Tartars,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;do not kill in the same way as the Kitat; they cut the
throat, we go straight to the heart.&nbsp; By our method, the
animal suffers less, and all the blood is, as it should be,
retained in the interior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The transmigration once operated, nobody had any further
scruples.&nbsp; Our Dchiahour and the Tartar Lama turned back
their sleeves, and advanced to assist the little butcher.&nbsp;
The sheep was skinned with admirable celerity.&nbsp; Meantime the
mother of the Lama had made the two pots boil.&nbsp; She now took
the entrails of the sheep, washed them pretty clean, and then,
with the blood which she took from the interior of the sheep by
means of a large wooden spoon, prepared some puddings, the basis
of which was the never-failing oatmeal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs
Lamas,&rdquo; said the little layman, &ldquo;shall I bone the
sheep?&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon our answering in the affirmative, he had
the animal hooked upon the tent, for he was not big enough to
perform that operation himself; he then mounted upon a large
stone, and passing his knife rapidly along the bones, he
detached, in one piece, all the meat, so as to leave dangling
from the tent a mere skeleton, clean, cleared, and nicely
polished.</p>
<p>While the little layman was, according to his expression,
putting in order the flesh of the sheep, the rest of the company
had prepared a gala in the Tartar fashion.&nbsp; The young Lama
was director of the feast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;let us all sit round; the great pot is going to be
emptied.&rdquo;&nbsp; Forthwith everyone sat down upon the
turf.&nbsp; The old Mongol woman plunged both hands into the pot,
which was boiling over, and drew out all the intestines&mdash;the
liver, the heart, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bowels,
stuffed with blood and oatmeal.&nbsp; In this gastronomical
preparation, the most remarkable thing was, that all the
intestines had been retained in their integrity, so that they
presented themselves much as they are seen in the living
beast.&nbsp; The old woman served up, or rather threw this
splendid dish upon the lawn, which was at once our chair, table,
plate, and, in case of need, our napkin.&nbsp; It is unnecessary
to add, that we used our fingers instead of forks.&nbsp; Everyone
seized with his hands a portion of the bowels, twisted it from
the mass, and devoured it without seasoning or salt.</p>
<p><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>The two French missionaries were not able, despite
their utmost willingness, to do honour to this Tartar dish.&nbsp;
First we burned our fingers when we tried to touch the hot and
smoking repast.&nbsp; Although our guests urged that it ought not
to be allowed to grow cold, we waited a little, afraid of burning
our lips also.&nbsp; At last we tasted these puddings of
sheep&rsquo;s blood and oatmeal, but after getting down a few
mouthsful, we were quite satisfied.&nbsp; Never, perhaps, had we
eaten anything so utterly tasteless and insipid.&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba, having foreseen this, had withdrawn from the
common dish, the liver and the kidneys, which he placed before
us, with some salt, which he had previously crushed between two
stones.&nbsp; We were thus enabled to keep pace with the company,
who, with a devouring appetite, were swallowing the vast system
of entrails.</p>
<p>When the whole had disappeared, the old woman brought up the
second service, by placing in the midst of us the large pot in
which the puddings had been cooked.&nbsp; Instantly all the
members of the banquet invited each other, and every one taking
from his bosom his wooden porringer, ladled out bumpers of a
smoking, salt liquid, which they dignified with the pompous name
of sauce.&nbsp; As we did not wish to appear eccentric, or as if
we despised the Tartar cuisine, we did like the rest.&nbsp; We
plunged our porringer into the pot, but it was only by the most
laudable efforts that we could get down this green stuff, which
gave us the idea of half masticated grass.&nbsp; The Tartars, on
the contrary, found it delicious, and readily reached the bottom
of the extempore tureen, not stopping for a moment, till nothing
was left&mdash;not a drop of sauce, not an inch of pudding.</p>
<p>When the feast was finished, the little layman took leave,
receiving as his fee the four feet of the sheep.&nbsp; To this
fee, fixed by the old custom of the Mongols, we added, as a
supplement, a handful of tea leaves, for we desired that he
should long remember and talk to his countrymen of the generosity
of the Lamas of the Western sky.</p>
<p>Every one having now thoroughly regaled, our neighbours took
their kitchen utensils and returned home, except the young Lama,
who said he would not leave us alone.&nbsp; After much talk about
the east and the west, he took down the skeleton, which was still
hanging at the entrance of the tent, and amused himself with
reciting, or rather singing, the nomenclature of all the bones,
large and small, that compose the frame of the sheep.&nbsp; He
perceived that our knowledge on this subject was very limited,
and this extremely astonished him; and we had the greatest
trouble to make him understand, that in our country
ecclesiastical studies had for their object more <!-- page
216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>serious and important matters than the names and number
of the bones of a sheep.</p>
<p>Every Mongol knows the number, the name, and the position of
the bones which compose the frame of animals; and thus they never
break the bones when they are cutting up an ox or a sheep.&nbsp;
With the point of their large knife they go straight and at once
to the juncture of the bones and separate them with astonishing
skill and celerity.&nbsp; These frequent dissections, and
especially the habit of being every day amongst their flocks,
make the Tartars well acquainted with the diseases of animals,
and skilful in their cure.&nbsp; The remedies, which they employ
internally, are always simples gathered in the prairie, and the
decoction of which they make the sick animals drink.&nbsp; For
this purpose, they use a large cow-horn.&nbsp; When they have
contrived to insert the small end of this into the mouth of the
animal, they pour the physic in at the other extremity, as
through a funnel.&nbsp; If the beast persists in not opening its
mouth, the liquid is administered through the nostrils.&nbsp;
Sometimes the Tartars employ a lavement in their treatment of the
diseases of animals; but their instruments are still of primitive
simplicity.&nbsp; A cow&rsquo;s horn serves for the pipe, and the
pump is a great bladder, worked by squeezing it.</p>
<p>Internal remedies, however, are not very often applied; the
Tartars make more frequent use of punctures and incisions in
different parts of the body.&nbsp; Some of these operations are
extremely ludicrous.&nbsp; One day, when we had pitched our tent
beside a Mongol dwelling, a Tartar brought to the chief of the
family a cow, which, he said, would not eat, and which was pining
away day by day.&nbsp; The chief examined the animal, opened its
mouth, and rubbed its fore teeth with his nail.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fool, blockhead,&rdquo; said he to the man who had come to
ask his advice, &ldquo;why did not you come before?&nbsp; Your
cow is on the verge of death; there is scarce a day&rsquo;s life
more in her.&nbsp; Yet, there may be tried one means: I will
attempt it.&nbsp; If your cow dies, you will say it is your own
fault; if it recovers, you will regard it as a great favour from
Hormousdha, operated by my skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; He called some of
his slaves, and ordered them to keep a firm hold of the beast,
while he was operating upon it.&nbsp; Then he entered his tent,
whence he soon returned, armed with a nail and a great
hammer.&nbsp; We waited with impatience this strange chirurgical
operation, which was to be performed with a nail and a
hammer.&nbsp; While several Mongols held the cow, in order to
prevent its running away, the operator placed the nail under its
belly, and then drove it in up to the head with a violent stroke
of the hammer.&nbsp; Next, he seized with both hands the tail of
the cow, and ordered those who were holding it to let go.&nbsp;
Instantly, the animal that had been so very <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>singularly
operated upon, dashed off, dragging after it the veterinary
Tartar, clinging to its tail.&nbsp; In this fashion, they ran
nearly a li.&nbsp; The Tartar then quitted his victim, and came
quietly back to us, who were quite amazed at this new method of
curing cows.&nbsp; He declared there was no further danger for
the beast; for he had ascertained, he said, by the stiffness of
the tail, the good effect of the ferruginous medicine he had
administered.</p>
<p>The Tartar veterinarians sometimes perform their operations at
the belly, as we have just seen; but it is more generally, with
the head, ears, temple, upper lip, and about the eyes that they
deal.&nbsp; The latter operation is principally had recourse to,
in the disease which the Tartar&rsquo;s call Hen&rsquo;s dung, to
which mules are greatly subject.&nbsp; When this disease breaks
out, the animals leave off eating, and fall into extreme
weakness, so that they can hardly keep themselves on their legs;
fleshy excrescences, similar to the excrements of poultry, grow
under the lids, in the corners of the eyes.&nbsp; If these
excrescences are removed in time, the mules are saved, and
recover by degrees their original vigour; if not, they pine for a
few days, and then die.</p>
<p>Although cupping and bleeding have great place in the
veterinary art of the Tartars, you must not suppose that they
have at their disposal fine collections of instruments, such as
those of European operators.&nbsp; Most of them have nothing but
their ordinary knife, or the small iron awl, which they keep in
their girdle, and which they use daily to clear their pipes, and
mend their saddles and leathern boots.</p>
<p>The young Lama who had sold us the sheep, spent a great part
of the day in telling us anecdotes, more or less piquant and
curious, about the veterinary science in which he seemed to be
very skilful.&nbsp; Moreover, he gave us important instructions
concerning the road we had to pursue.&nbsp; He settled the stages
we ought to make, and indicated the places where we should
encamp, so as to prevent our dying from thirst.&nbsp; We had
still before us in the country of the Ortous, a journey of about
fourteen days; in all that time we should find neither rivulet,
nor spring, nor cistern; but only, at certain distances, wells of
an extraordinary depth; some of them distant from each other two
days&rsquo; march, so that we should have to carry with us our
provision of water.</p>
<p>Next morning, after having paid our respects to the Tartar
family, who had shown us so much kindness, we proceeded on our
way.&nbsp; Towards evening, when it was nearly time to pitch our
tent, we perceived in the distance a large assemblage of various
herds.&nbsp; Thinking that one of the indicated wells lay
probably there, we bent our steps in the direction, and soon
found that we were <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>correct in our anticipation; the
water was before us.&nbsp; The beasts were collected from every
quarter, waiting to be watered.&nbsp; We halted accordingly, and
set up our encampment.&nbsp; As we gazed upon the assembled
flocks, and the well, the covering of which was a large stone, we
recalled with pleasure the passage of Genesis, which relates the
journey of Jacob in Mesopotamia, to Laban, son of Bathuel the
Syrian.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then Jacob went on his journey, and came
into the land of the people of the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo,
there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that
well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the
well&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they
rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, and watered the
sheep, and put the stone again upon the well&rsquo;s mouth in its
place.&rdquo; <a name="citation218a"></a><a href="#footnote218a"
class="citation">[218a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wooden troughs placed around the well, reminded us of the
other passage, where the meeting of Rebecca with the servant of
Abraham is related.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And when she had done giving him drink, she
said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done
drinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the
trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for
all his camels.&rdquo; <a name="citation218b"></a><a
href="#footnote218b" class="citation">[218b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One cannot travel in Mongolia, amongst a pastoral and nomad
population, without one&rsquo;s mind involuntarily going back to
the time of the first patriarch, whose pastoral life had so close
a relation with the manners and customs which we still find
amongst the Mongol tribes.&nbsp; But how sad and painful do these
coincidences become, when we reflect that these unfortunate
people are still ignorant of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob.</p>
<p>We had scarcely pitched our tent, and arranged our modest
kitchen, when we saw several Tartar horsemen advancing at full
gallop.&nbsp; They were coming to draw water and give it to the
numerous flocks that had been long awaiting them.&nbsp; These
animals, which had hitherto stood at a distance, seeing the
shepherds approach, hastened to the spot, and soon all were
grouped round the well, eager to quench their thirst.&nbsp; This
large assemblage of animals, so numerous and so various, created
an agitation, a tumult to which we were quite unused amid the
silent solitude of the desert; and it was perhaps on account of
its novelty that this confusion was, to us, full of
entertainment.&nbsp; It was amusing to see the half-tamed horses
pushing and struggling to arrive first at the well; <!-- page
219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>then, instead of drinking in peace, biting,
quarrelling, and even leaving the water in order to pursue each
other on the plain.&nbsp; The scene was especially entertaining
and picturesque, when an enormous camel came forward, spreading
alarm round the well, and driving away the vulgar herd by its
despotic presence.</p>
<p>There were four Mongol shepherds; while two of them, armed
with a long rod, ran about trying to effect a little order among
the flocks, the two others drew the water in a manner which
greatly excited our surprise.&nbsp; First, the utensil they used
by way of pail, appeared to us very remarkable; it was the entire
skin of a goat, solidly fastened at the four feet, the only
opening being at the neck.&nbsp; A hoop kept this orifice open; a
long, strong rope of camel&rsquo;s hair was fastened at one end
to the wooden handle that crossed the diameter of the orifice,
and at the other end to the saddle of the horse ridden by one of
the Tartars, who, when the skin was filled rode off, and thus
hauled up the bucket to the edge of the well, where it was
received by another man, who emptied its contents into the
troughs.</p>
<p>The well was of astonishing depth; the rope used to raise the
bucket seemed more than 200 feet long.&nbsp; Instead of running
in a pulley, it went right over a large stone, in which a large
groove was already made by the constant friction.&nbsp; Although
the drawing up of the water was performed with great activity, it
was nearly dark before all the flock had been watered; we then
brought our five animals to participate in the general banquet,
and the Tartars had the complaisance to draw water also for us;
otherwise, it is probable we should never have got it, but have
been obliged to suffer thirst beside an abundant well.</p>
<p>These Tartars did not seem contented, like those we had met
with in the other parts of Mongolia; we saw they were very
depressed at being obliged to spend their lives in such a barren
country, where pasturage is so very scarce and water still
rarer.&nbsp; They talked to us of the Mongol kingdoms through
which we had passed, and where it was so easy, so agreeable
indeed, to feed animals.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, how happy are the
inhabitants of these countries!&rdquo; said they.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How fortunate were we, could we spend our days amidst
those rich pasturages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they returned to their dwelling, which lay behind a
high mountain, these Tartars told us that we ought to depart next
morning before daybreak, for that we should not find any water
until we came to the Hundred Wells, which was distant a hundred
and fifty lis (fifteen leagues).</p>
<p>Dawn had not yet appeared when we left.&nbsp; The country was,
as before, sandy, barren, and dismal.&nbsp; About noon we halted,
in <!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>order to take a little food, and to make tea with the
water we had brought with us on one of the camels.&nbsp; Night
was setting in before we reached the Hundred Wells; our poor
animals could hardly move for hunger and fatigue; yet, at all
cost, we were obliged to reach the encampment.&nbsp; To remain
where we were would have caused infinite wretchedness.&nbsp; At
last we came to the wells, and without troubling ourselves to
ascertain whether or no there were a hundred of them, as the
Tartar name of the place imported, we hastened to pitch our
tent.&nbsp; Happily the well was not so deep as that we had seen
the night before.&nbsp; Our first care was to draw some water for
the horse and the mule; but when we went to lead them to the
trough, we did not find them near the tent, where they usually
stood to be unsaddled.&nbsp; This misfortune occasioned us an
alarm that made us forget the fatigues of the day.&nbsp; We had,
it is true, no fear of robbers, for in this respect no country is
more safe than the Ortous; but we thought that our animals,
thirsty as they were, had run away in search of water.&nbsp; They
will go, meditated we, till they have found water; perhaps they
will go without stopping to the frontier of the Ortous to the
fiery banks of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>The night was quite dark; nevertheless, we thought it proper
to go instantly in search of our horses, while Samdadchiemba was
preparing supper.&nbsp; We wandered about for a long time in all
directions without seeing anything; ever and anon we stopped to
listen whether we could distinguish the sound of the bells
suspended from the horse&rsquo;s neck; but our efforts were vain;
nothing interrupted the dead silence of the desert.&nbsp; We went
on, without losing courage, still hoping to find animals so very
necessary to us, and the loss of which would have placed us in
such difficulties.&nbsp; Sometimes we fancied we heard in the
distance the tinkling of the bells.&nbsp; Then we laid flat down,
applying our ears to the earth, in order to catch more readily
the slightest noise that might occur; but it was all in vain; our
search was fruitless.</p>
<p>The fear of losing our way in a dark night in a country, the
bearings of which we had not been able to examine, made us think
of retracing our steps.&nbsp; Judge of our consternation when, on
turning round, we perceived, apparently in the place where we had
pitched our tent, a large volume of flame and smoke rising.&nbsp;
We did not doubt for an instant that Samdadchiemba also had set
out in search of the animals, and that in his absence the tent
had caught fire.&nbsp; Oh, how sad and discouraging was that
moment.&nbsp; In the middle of the desert, at two thousand
lis&rsquo; distance from our christendom, we contemplated without
hope those flames consuming our tent, our sole shelter against
the inclemency of the weather.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; we said,
<!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;the tent is certainly destroyed, and doubtless
all that was in it has also become a prey to the
flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We mournfully directed our steps to the place of our
encampment.&nbsp; Though anxious to ascertain our misfortune, we
advanced slowly, for we were, at the same time, afraid to
approach the fearful spectacle, destructive of our plans, and
plunging us into misery of every description.&nbsp; As we
advanced, we heard loud cries; at last we distinguished the voice
of Samdadchiemba, apparently calling for assistance.&nbsp;
Imagining that we could still save something from the
conflagration, we hastened to the spot, calling out, at the pitch
of our voices, that we were coming.&nbsp; When we at last arrived
at the encampment, we stood for an instant quite stupified upon
seeing Samdadchiemba quietly seated beside an immense fire, and
drinking with the greatest satisfaction bumpers of tea.&nbsp; The
tent was untouched, and all our animals lying around it: there
had been no conflagration at all.&nbsp; The Dchiahour, having
found the horse and the mule, had imagined that, having doubtless
got to some distance, we should have a difficulty in finding our
way back to the encampment, and therefore he had made a large
fire to direct our steps, and sent forth vehement cries inviting
us to return.&nbsp; We had so fully believed in the reality of
our misfortune that, on beholding our tent again, we seemed to
pass at once from the extreme of misery to the height of
happiness.</p>
<p>As the night had already made considerable progress, we
hastened to eat, with excellent appetite, the soup that
Samdadchiemba had prepared, and then laid down upon our
goat-skins, where we enjoyed a profound sleep till daybreak.</p>
<p>On getting up next morning a glance around the encampment
diffused a shudder of terror through all our limbs; for we found
ourselves surrounded on every side by deep wells.&nbsp; We had
been, indeed, told that we should not find water until we reached
the place called Hundred Wells, but we had never imagined, that
this denomination, Hundred Wells, was to be taken
literally.&nbsp; When we had pitched our tent the night before,
it was too dark for us to remark the presence of these numerous
precipices, and accordingly we had taken no precautions.&nbsp;
When we went out in search of our stray animals we had, without
knowing it, made a thousand turnings and windings amongst these
deep pits; and that we had thus walked in a dark night, without
any accident, could only be attributed to a special protection of
Providence.&nbsp; Before our departure, therefore, we planted a
small wooden cross on the brink of one of these wells, as a sign
of our thankfulness for the goodness of God.</p>
<p>After having made our usual breakfast, we proceeded.&nbsp;
Towards <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>noon we perceived before us a great
multitude issuing from a narrow defile, formed by two precipitous
mountains.&nbsp; We were lost in conjecture as to what this
numerous and imposing caravan could be.&nbsp; Innumerable camels,
laden with baggage, advanced in single file, one after the other,
escorted on either side by a number of horsemen, who, in the
distance, appeared to be richly attired.&nbsp; We slackened our
pace, to obtain a nearer view of this caravan, which appeared to
us a very strange affair.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p222.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=
"Encampment at the Hundred Wells"
title=
"Encampment at the Hundred Wells"
src="images/p222.jpg" />
</a>It was still a considerable distance off, when four horsemen,
who formed a sort of vanguard, galloped on towards us.&nbsp; They
were all four Mandarins, as we perceived from the blue button
which surmounted their cap of ceremony.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs
Lamas,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;peace be with you!&nbsp; Towards
what point of the earth do you direct your steps?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are of the West, and it is to the West <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>we
are going.&nbsp; And you, brothers of Mongolia, whither do you
travel in so large a troop, and in such magnificent
apparel?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are from the kingdom of Alechan,
and our king is making a journey to Peking to prostrate himself
at the feet of Him who dwells above the sky.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
these few words the four horsemen rose somewhat in their saddles,
saluted, and then returned to their position at the head of the
caravan.</p>
<p>We had thus encountered on his way the King of Alechan,
repairing to Peking with his gorgeous retinue, to be present at
the great meeting of the tributary princes, who, on the first day
of the first moon, are bound to offer the compliments of the new
year to the Emperor.&nbsp; Behind the vanguard came a palanquin
carried by two splendid mules, harnessed, the one before, the
other behind, to gilt shafts.&nbsp; The palanquin was square,
plain, and by no means elegant; its roof was adorned with some
silk fringe, and its four panels were decorated with some
pictures of dragons, birds, and nosegays.&nbsp; The Tartar
monarch was sitting, not upon a seat, but with his legs crossed,
in the oriental fashion.&nbsp; He seemed to be about fifty years
old; and his full round features gave to his physiognomy a
remarkable air of good nature.&nbsp; As he passed us, we cried:
&ldquo;King of the Alechan, peace and happiness be on your
way!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Men of prayer,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;may you also be at peace,&rdquo; and he accompanied these
words with a friendly salute.&nbsp; An old white-bearded Lama,
mounted upon a magnificent horse, led the fore mule of the
palanquin; he was considered the guide of the whole
caravan.&nbsp; Generally, the great marches of the Tartars are
under the guidance of the most venerable of the Lamas of the
district; for these people are persuaded, that they have nothing
to fear on their way, so long as they have at their head, a
representative of the divinity, or rather the divinity himself
incarnate in the person of the Lama.</p>
<p>A great number of horsemen, who surrounded, as a guard of
honour, the royal palanquin, made their horses curvet
incessantly, and dash up and down, in and out, from one side to
the other, without ever stopping in their rapid movements.&nbsp;
Immediately behind the carriage of the king, came a white camel
of extraordinary beauty and size; a young Tartar, on foot, led it
by a silken string.&nbsp; This camel was not laden.&nbsp; From
the tip of each hump, which looked like two pyramids, floated
pieces of yellow taffeta.&nbsp; There was no doubt, that this
magnificent animal was a present destined for the Chinese
Emperor.&nbsp; The remainder of the troop consisted of numerous
camels, carrying the baggage, the boxes, tents, pots, the
thousand and one utensils, that are always wanted in a country
where no tavern is to be found.</p>
<p>The caravan had passed on a long time, when meeting with a
<!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>well, we resolved to pitch our tent beside it.&nbsp;
While we were making our tea, three Tartars, one decorated with
the red, the other with the blue button, alighted at the entrance
of our dwelling.&nbsp; They asked for news of the caravan of the
King of the Alechans.&nbsp; We answered that we had met it a long
time since, that it must already be at a considerable distance,
and that it would doubtless arrive, before night, at the
encampment of the Hundred Wells.&nbsp; &ldquo;As it is so,&rdquo;
they said, &ldquo;we would rather remain here, than arrive by
night at the Hundred Wells, at the risk of falling into some
hole.&nbsp; Tomorrow, by starting a little before day, we shall
reach the caravan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner said than done: the Tartars forthwith unsaddled
their horses, sent them off to seek their fortune in the desert,
and without ceremony took their seat beside our fire.&nbsp; They
were all Taitsi of the kingdom of the Alechan.&nbsp; One of
these, he who wore the cap with the red button, was the
king&rsquo;s minister; they all three belonged to the great
caravan, but the day before, having started to visit a friend, a
prince of the Ortous, they had been left behind by the main
body.</p>
<p>The minister of the King of Alechan had an open, frank
character, and a very acute understanding; he combined Mongol
good nature with vivacious and elegant manners, which he had no
doubt acquired in his frequent visits to Peking.&nbsp; He asked
many questions about the country which the Tartars call the
Western Heaven, and informed us, that every three years a great
number of our countrymen, from the different western kingdoms,
rendered their homage to the Emperor at Peking.</p>
<p>It is needless to observe that, for the most part, the Tartars
do not carry very far their geographical studies.&nbsp; The west
means with them simply Thibet and some adjacent countries, which
they hear mentioned by the Lamas, who have made the pilgrimage to
Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; They firmly believe that beyond Thibet there is
nothing; there, say they, is the end of the world; beyond, there
is merely a shoreless ocean.</p>
<p>When we had satisfied all the inquiries of the red button, we
addressed some to him about the country of the Alechan, and the
journey to Peking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every third year all the
sovereigns of the world,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;repair to Peking,
for the feast of the new year.&nbsp; Princes who live near, are
bound to go thither every year; those who live at the extremities
of the earth, go every second or third year, according to the
distance they have to travel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your
purpose in going every year to Peking?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
ourselves go as the retinue of our king; the king alone enjoys
the happiness of prostrating himself in the presence of the Old
Buddha (the <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Emperor).&rdquo;&nbsp; He entered
then into long details about the ceremony of the first day of the
year, and the relations between the Chinese Emperor and the
tributary kings.</p>
<p>The foreign sovereigns, under the dominating influence of the
China empire, repair to Peking; first, as an act of obeisance and
submission: secondly, to pay certain rents to the Emperor, whose
vassals they consider themselves.&nbsp; These rents, which are
decorated with the fine name of offerings, are, in fact, imposts
which no Tartar king would venture to refuse the payment
of.&nbsp; They consist in camels, in horses remarkable for their
beauty, and which the Emperor sends to augment his immense herds
in the Tchakar.&nbsp; Every Tartar prince is, besides, obliged to
bring some of the rarer productions of his country; deer, bear
and goat venison; aromatic plants, pheasants, mushrooms, fish,
etc.&nbsp; As they visit Peking in the depth of winter, all these
eatables are frozen; so that they bear, without danger of being
spoiled, the trial of a long journey, and even remain good long
after they have arrived at their destination.</p>
<p>One of the Banners of the Tchakar is especially charged with
sending to Peking, every year, an immense provision of
pheasant&rsquo;s eggs.&nbsp; We asked the minister of the King of
the Alechan, whether these pheasant&rsquo;s eggs were of a
peculiar flavour, that they were so highly appreciated by the
Court.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are not destined to be eaten,&rdquo; he
answered; &ldquo;the Old Buddha uses them for another
purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As they are not eaten, what are they
used for?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Tartar seemed embarrassed, and blushed
somewhat as he replied that these eggs were used to make a sort
of varnish, which the women of the imperial harem used for the
purpose of smoothing their hair, and which communicates to it,
they say, a peculiar lustre and brilliancy.&nbsp; Europeans,
perhaps, may consider this pomatum of pheasant&rsquo;s eggs, so
highly esteemed at the Chinese court, very nasty and disgusting;
but beauty and ugliness, the nice and the nasty, are, as
everybody knows, altogether relative and conventional matters,
upon which the various nations that inhabit this earth have ideas
remotest from the uniform.</p>
<p>These annual visits to the Emperor of China are very expensive
and extremely troublesome to the Tartars of the plebeian class,
who are overwhelmed with enforced labour, at the pleasure of
their masters, and are bound to provide a certain number of
camels and horses, to carry the baggage of the king and the
nobles.&nbsp; As these journeys take place in the depth of
winter, the animals find little food, especially when, after
leaving the Land of Grass, they enter upon the districts
cultivated by the Chinese; and a great number of them,
accordingly, die on the road.&nbsp; Hence, when the caravan
returns, it is far from being in such good order and condition as
when <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>it started; it presents, one might
almost say, merely the skeletons of the animals.&nbsp; Those
which have still retained a little strength are laden with the
baggage necessary on the way; the others are dragged along by the
halter, scarcely able to move one leg before the other.&nbsp; It
is a very sad, and, at the same time, singular thing, to see the
Mongols walking on foot, and leading behind them horses which
they dare not mount for fear of breaking them down.</p>
<p>As soon as the tributary kings are arrived at Peking, they
repair to the interior of the city, where they inhabit a quarter
especially set apart for them.&nbsp; They are generally two
hundred in number, each of whom has his palace or inn, which he
occupies, with his retinue.&nbsp; A Mandarin, a grand dignitary
of the realm, superintends this quarter, and has it in charge to
maintain peace and concord amongst these illustrious
visitors.&nbsp; The tributes are transferred to the care of a
special Mandarin, whom we may consider as steward of the
household.</p>
<p>During their stay at Peking, these monarchs have no
communication with the Emperor, no solemn audience.&nbsp; Some of
them may perchance obtain admittance to the throne; but it is
only upon affairs of the highest importance, above the
jurisdiction of the ordinary ministers.</p>
<p>On the first day of the year, however, there is a solemn
ceremony, at which these two hundred monarchs are admitted to a
sort of contact with their suzerain and master, with him who, as
they phrase it, sitting beneath the sky, rules the four seas and
the ten thousand nations of the world by a single act of his
will.&nbsp; According to the ritual which regulates the state
proceedings of the Emperor of China, he is bound to visit every
year, on the first day of the first moon, the temple of his
ancestors, and to prostrate himself before the tablet of his
fathers.&nbsp; There is before the entrance of this temple a long
avenue, wherein the tributary princes, who have come to Peking to
render homage to the Emperor, assemble.&nbsp; They range
themselves right and left of the peristyle, in three lines, each
occupying the place appertaining to his dignity.&nbsp; They stand
erect, grave, and silent.&nbsp; It is said to be a fine and
imposing spectacle, to witness all these remote monarchs, attired
in their silk robes, embroidered with gold and silver, and
indicating, by the variety of their costumes, the different
countries they inhabit, and the degrees of their dignity.</p>
<p>Meantime the Emperor issues in great pomp from his Yellow
Town.&nbsp; He traverses the deserted and silent streets of
Peking; for, when the Asiatic tyrant appears, every door must be
closed, and every inhabitant of the town must, on pain of death,
remain silent within his house.&nbsp; As soon as the Emperor has
arrived at the <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>temple of the ancestors, the
heralds, who precede the procession, cry out, at the moment he
places his foot on the first step of the stairs that lead to the
gallery of the tributary kings: &ldquo;Let all prostrate
themselves, for here is the Lord of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
this the two hundred tributary kings respond in unison:
&ldquo;Ten thousand congratulations!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, having
thus wished a happy new year to the Emperor, they all fall down
with their face towards the earth.&nbsp; Then passes through
their ranks, the son of heaven, who enters the temple of the
ancestors, and prostrates himself, in his turn, thrice before the
tablet of his fathers.&nbsp; Whilst the Emperor is offering up
his adoration to the spirits of his family, the two hundred
monarchs remain prostrate on the earth, and they do not rise
until the Emperor has again passed through their ranks; after
this they re-enter their litters and return to their respective
palaces.</p>

</a></p>
<p>And such is the entire and sole fruit of the long patience of
these potentates, after leaving their distant countries, and
enduring fatigues and dangers of every description, and a long
journey through the desert: they have enjoyed the happiness of
prostrating <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>themselves in the path of the
Emperor!&nbsp; Such a spectacle would with us Europeans be a
matter of pity and disgust, for we could not comprehend how there
should be so much humility on one side, so much arrogance on the
other.&nbsp; Yet it is the simplest thing in the world to Asiatic
nations.&nbsp; The Emperor takes his all-mightiness as a grave
matter of course; and the Tartar kings think themselves happy and
honoured in paying homage to it.</p>
<p>The prime minister of the king of the Alechan told us that a
sight of the Emperor is not easily obtained.&nbsp; One year, when
his master was ill, he was obliged to take his place at Peking,
in the ceremony of the temple of the ancestors, and he then hoped
to see the Old Buddha, on his way down the peristyle, but he was
altogether mistaken in his expectation.&nbsp; As minister, the
mere representative of his monarch, he was placed in the third
file, so that, when the Emperor passed, he saw absolutely nothing
at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those who are in the first line,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;if they are cautiously dexterous, may manage to get
a glimpse of the yellow robe of the son of heaven; but they must
take heed not to lift up their heads, for such an audacity would
be considered a great crime, and be punished very
severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Tartar princes are pensioned by the Emperor; the sum
allotted to them is a small matter, but it effects a considerable
political result.&nbsp; The Tartar princes, in receiving their
pay, consider themselves the slaves, or at least, as the servants
of him who pays them; and concede, in consequence, to the Emperor
the right of requiring their submission and obedience.&nbsp; It
is about the first day of the year that the tributary sovereigns
receive, at Peking, the allotted pension, which is distributed by
some of the great Mandarins, who are said, by slanderous tongues,
to speculate in this lucrative employment, and never fail to make
enormous profits at the expense of the poor Tartars.</p>
<p>The minister of the king of the Alechan related, for our
edification, that in a particular year, all the tributary princes
received their pension in ingots of gilt copper.&nbsp; All found
it out at once, but were fain to keep silence, afraid to make
public an affair that might result in a catastrophe,
compromising, not only the highest dignitaries of the empire, but
the Tartar kings themselves.&nbsp; As, in fact, the latter were
supposed to receive their money from the hands of the Emperor
himself, a complaint would, in some sort, have been to charge the
Old Buddha, the son of heaven, with being a coiner.&nbsp; They
received accordingly their copper ingots with a prostration, and
it was not until they returned into their own countries, that
they declared, not indeed that they had been cheated, but that
the Mandarins, charged with distributing the money, had been <!--
page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>the dupes of the Peking bankers.&nbsp; The Tartar
Mandarin who related the adventure, gave us completely to
understand that neither the Emperor, nor the courtiers, nor the
Mandarins, had anything to do with the affair.&nbsp; We took good
care not to undeceive him: as to us, who had no great faith in
the probity of the government of Peking, we were convinced that
the Emperor had regularly swindled the Tartar kings.&nbsp; We
were confirmed in this opinion by the fact that the period of
this adventure coincided with the British war; when, as we knew,
the Emperor was in the last extremity, and knew not where to get
the money necessary to keep from starving the handful of soldiers
who were charged with the preservation of the integrity of the
Chinese territory.</p>
<p>The visit of the three Mandarins of the Alechan was not only
pleasant on account of the narrative they gave us of the
relations of the Tartar kings with the Emperor, but it was of
essential utility to us.&nbsp; When they understood that we were
directing our steps towards the West, they asked us whether we
intended passing through the district of the Alechan.&nbsp; On
our answering in the affirmative, they dissuaded us from the
project; they told us that our animals would perish there, for
not a single pasturage was to be met with.&nbsp; We already knew
that the Alechan is a tract still more barren than the
Ortous.&nbsp; It consists, in fact, of chains of lofty mountains
of sand, where you may travel sometimes for whole days together,
without seeing a single blade of vegetation.&nbsp; Some narrow
valleys, here and there, alone offer to the flocks a few thorny
and wretched plants.&nbsp; On this account the Alechan is very
thinly inhabited, even in comparison with the other parts of
Mongolia.</p>
<p>The Mandarins told us that this year the drought which had
been general throughout Tartary had rendered the district of the
Alechan almost uninhabitable.&nbsp; They assured us that at least
one-third of the flocks had perished of hunger and thirst, and
that the remainder were in a wretched state.&nbsp; For their
journey to Peking, they had, they said, chosen the best they
could find in the country; and we might have observed that the
animals of the caravan were very different indeed from those we
had seen in Tchakar.&nbsp; The drought, the want of water and
pastures, the destruction of the flocks&mdash;all this had given
birth to an utter state of misery, whence, again, numerous bands
of robbers who were ravaging the country, and robbing
travellers.&nbsp; They assured us that, being so few in number,
it would not be wise for us to enter upon the Alechan mountains,
particularly in the absence of the principal authorities.</p>
<p>On receiving this information, we resolved not to retrace our
steps, for we were too far advanced, but to diverge a little from
our <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>route.&nbsp; The night was far
advanced ere we thought of taking rest; we had scarcely slept a
few minutes, in fact, when the day broke.&nbsp; The Tartars
saddled their steeds, and after having wished us peace and
happiness, dashed off at full gallop, to overtake the great
caravan which preceded them.</p>
<p>As for us, before setting out, we unrolled the excellent map
of the Chinese empire, published by M. Andriveau-Goujon, and
sought upon it to what point we ought to direct our steps, so as
to avoid the wretched district of the Alechan, without, however,
deviating too much from our route.&nbsp; After looking at the
map, we saw no other way than to recross the Yellow River, to
pass the Great Wall of China, and to travel across the Chinese
province of Kan-Sou, until we arrived among the Tartars of the
Koukou-Noor.&nbsp; Formerly this determination would have made us
tremble.&nbsp; Accustomed as we had been to live privately in our
Chinese christendom, it would have seemed to us impossible to
enter the Chinese empire alone, and without the care of a
catechist.&nbsp; At that time it would have seemed to us clear as
the day, that our strangulation, and the persecution of all the
Chinese missions, would have been the certain result of our rash
undertaking.&nbsp; Such would have been our fears formerly, but
the time of our fear was gone.&nbsp; Indurated by our two months
journey, we had come to the persuasion that we might travel in
China with as much safety as in Tartary.&nbsp; The stay that we
had already made in several large commercial towns, compelled as
we had been to manage our own affairs, had rendered the Chinese
manners and customs more familiar to us.&nbsp; The language
presented to us no difficulties; besides being able to speak the
Tartar idiom, we were familiar with the colloquial phrases of the
Chinese, a very difficult attainment to those who reside in the
missions, because the Christians there seek to flatter them by
only employing, in the presence of the Missionaries, the short
vocabulary of words that they have studied in books.&nbsp;
Besides these purely moral and intellectual advantages, our long
journey had been useful in a physical point of view; the rain,
the wind, and the sun, which had during two months raged against
our European tint, had in the end embrowned and tanned it so,
that we looked quite like wild men of the wood in this
respect.&nbsp; The fear of being recognised by the Chinese now no
longer troubled us.</p>
<p>We told Samdadchiemba that we should cease, in a few days, to
travel in the Land of Grass, and that we should continue our
route through the Chinese empire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Travel among the
Chinese!&rdquo; said the Dchiahour; &ldquo;very well.&nbsp; There
are good inns there.&nbsp; They boil good tea there.&nbsp; When
it rains, you can go under shelter.&nbsp; During the night, you
are not disturbed by the blowing of the <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>north
wind.&nbsp; But in China, there are ten thousand roads; which
shall we take?&nbsp; Do we know which is the best?&rdquo;&nbsp;
We made him look at the map, pointing out all the places which we
should have to pass before we reached Koukou-Noor.&nbsp; We even
reduced, for his edification, into lis, all the distances from
one town to the other.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba looked at our small
geographical chart with perfect enthusiasm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how sincerely I regret that I
did not study while I was in the Lamasery; if I had listened to
my master, if I had paid more attention, I might perhaps now
understand the description of the world, that is here drawn on
this piece of paper.&nbsp; With this, one can go everywhere,
without asking the way.&nbsp; Is it not so?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, everywhere,&rdquo; answered we; &ldquo;even to your
own family.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How is that? is my country also
written down here?&rdquo; and as he spoke he bent over the chart,
so as entirely to cover it with his huge frame.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stand aside and we will show you your country.&nbsp; Look;
do you see this little space beside that green line?&nbsp; That
is the country of the Dchiahours, which the Chinese call the
Three Valleys (San-Tchouen).&nbsp; Your village must be here; we
shall pass not more than two days&rsquo; journey from your
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; cried he,
striking his forehead; &ldquo;shall we pass two days&rsquo;
journey from my house?&nbsp; Do you say so?&nbsp; How can that
be?&nbsp; Not more than two days&rsquo; journey?&nbsp; In that
case, when we are near it, I will ask my spiritual fathers
permission to go and see once more my country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What can you have to do now in the Three
Valleys?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go and see what is doing
there.&nbsp; It is eighteen years since my departure from my
house.&nbsp; I will go and see if my old mother is still there;
and if she is alive, I will make her enter into the Holy
Church.&nbsp; As for my two brothers, who knows whether they will
have enough sense not to believe any longer in the
transmigrations of Buddha.&nbsp; Ah, yes,&rdquo; added he after a
short pause, &ldquo;I will make a little tea, and we will talk
this matter over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba was no longer with us; his thoughts had flown to
his native land.&nbsp; We were obliged to remind him of his real
position,&mdash;&ldquo;Samdadchiemba, you need not make any tea;
and just now, instead of talking, we must fold up our tent, load
the camels, and proceed on our way.&nbsp; Look; the sun is
already high in the heavens: if we do not get on, we shall never
reach the Three Valleys.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;True,&rdquo; cried
he; and springing up he set himself busily about making
preparations for our departure.</p>
<p>On resuming our route, we abandoned the direction towards the
west, which we had strictly followed during our journey, and
diverged a little to the south.&nbsp; After having continued our
march for half the day, we sat down for a while under a rock to
take our repast.&nbsp; As usual, we dined on bread and water; and
what bread <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>and water!&nbsp; Dough half baked,
and brackish water, which we had to draw up with the sweat of our
brow, and to carry about with us during our journey.</p>
<p>Towards the conclusion of our repast, while we were trying to
scrape together a few grains of tobacco in our snuff phials, by
way of desert, we saw coming towards us a Tartar on a camel; he
seated himself beside us.&nbsp; After having wished each other
peace, we let him smell at our empty snuff phial, and then
offered him a little loaf baked in the ashes.&nbsp; In an instant
he had swallowed the bread, and taken three sniffs of snuff.</p>
<p>We questioned him about the route; he told us that if we
followed the same direction we should arrive in two days at the
Yellow River, on crossing which, we should enter the Chinese
territory.&nbsp; This information gave us great satisfaction, for
it perfectly agreed with our map.&nbsp; We asked him if water was
far off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;the wells
are distant.&nbsp; If you encamp again to-day, you will find a
cistern on the way; but there is little water, and that is very
bad.&nbsp; Formerly it was an excellent well, but it is now
abandoned, for a tchutgour (demon) has corrupted its
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information induced us to proceed at once, for we had no
time to lose, if we desired to arrive before night.&nbsp; The
Mongol mounted his camel, which bounded across the desert, while
our little caravan continued slowly its uniform and monotonous
march.</p>
<p>Before sunset, we arrived at the indicated cistern, when we
pitched our tent, as there was no hope of finding further on
better water; besides, we fancied the cistern might perhaps turn
out less diabolical than the Tartar had pretended it to be.</p>
<p>While we were lighting the fire, the Dchiahour went to draw
water; he returned in a few moments, saying that it was unfit to
be drunk; that it was mere poison.&nbsp; He brought a basin full
with him, that we might taste it and judge for ourselves.</p>
<p>The stench of this dirty, muddy water was, indeed,
intolerable; and on the surface of the nauseous stuff, we saw
floating a sort of oily drop, which infinitely increased our
disgust.&nbsp; We had not the courage to raise it to our lips; we
were satisfied with its sight, and, above all, with its
smell.</p>
<p>Still we must either drink or die with thirst; we accordingly
resolved to make the best we could of this Cistern of the Devil,
as it is called by the Tartars.&nbsp; We collected roots, which
were growing abundantly around it, half buried in the sand; a few
moments labour supplied us with an ample provision of them.&nbsp;
Then, first of all, we made some charcoal which we broke into
small pieces; next we filled our kettle with the muddy, stinking
water, placed it <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>upon the fire, and when the water
boiled, threw in a quantity of the charcoal.</p>
<p>While we were engaged upon this chemical operation,
Samdadchiemba, seated beside the kettle, kept every moment asking
us what sort of soup we intended to make with all those
detestable ingredients.&nbsp; We gave him, by way of reply, a
complete dissertation upon the discolouring and disinfecting
properties of charcoal.&nbsp; He listened to our scientific
statement with patience, but appeared in no degree convinced by
it.&nbsp; His eyes were fixed upon the kettle, and it was easy to
see, from the sceptical expression of his features, that he had
no sort of expectation or idea that the thick water bubbling in
the kettle could at all become a clear and limpid fluid.</p>
<p>By-and-by, we poured out the liquid thus prepared, and
filtered it through an impromptu linen sieve.&nbsp; The water
realised was not, indeed, delicious, but it was drinkable, having
deposited all its salt and all its ill odour.&nbsp; We had more
than once, on our journey, used water in no degree superior.</p>
<p>Samdadchiemba was perfectly intoxicated with enthusiasm.&nbsp;
Had he not been a Christian, he would assuredly have taken us for
living Buddhas.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lamas,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;pretend they have all knowledge and all power in their
prayer books; but I am certain they would have died of thirst, or
been poisoned, had they only had the water of this cistern to
make tea with.&nbsp; They have no more notion than a sheep how to
render this bad water good.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he overwhelmed
us with all sorts of odd questions about the natural properties
of things.&nbsp; In relation to the purification of water which
we had just operated, he asked whether by rubbing his face hard
with the charcoal, he could make it as white as ours; but then,
when his eyes turned to his hands, still black with the charcoal
he had just broken up, he himself laughed immensely at the idea
he had propounded.</p>
<p>Night had set in before we had completed the distillation of
the water we required.&nbsp; We then made abundance of tea, and
the evening was occupied in drinking it.&nbsp; We contented
ourselves with infusing a few pinches of oatmeal in the tea, for
the ardent thirst which devoured us absorbed all desire to
eat.&nbsp; After having deluged our inward man, we sought
repose.</p>
<p>We had scarcely, however, stretched ourselves on the turf,
when an extraordinary and altogether unexpected noise threw us
into a state of stupor.&nbsp; It was a long, lugubrious, deep cry
that seemed approaching our tent.&nbsp; We had heard the howl of
wolves, the roar of tigers and of bears; but these in no way
resembled the sound which now affrighted our ears.&nbsp; It was
something like the bellowing of a bull, but crossed with tones so
strange and unintelligible, <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>that we
were utterly panic-stricken.&nbsp; And we were all the more
surprised and confounded, because everybody had assured us that
there were no wild beasts of any kind in the whole Ortous
country.</p>
<p>Our embarrassment was becoming serious.&nbsp; We were in fear
not only for our animals, which were tied round the tent, but
also on our own account.&nbsp; As the noise did not cease, but,
on the contrary, seemed to approach nearer and nearer, we got up,
not, indeed, to go forth in search of the villainous beast that
was thus disturbing our repose, but in order to try to frighten
it.&nbsp; To this intent all three of us set to work, shouting at
the pitch of our lungs; then we stopped, and so did the
beast.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s silence, the roaring was
heard once more, but at a considerable distance.&nbsp; We
conjectured that in our turn we had frightened the animal, and
this somewhat reassured us.</p>
<p>The cries once more approaching, we piled up some brushwood at
a few paces from the tent, and made a bonfire.&nbsp; The light,
instead of deterring the unknown monster, seemed rather to
attract it; and before long, by the flame of the brushwood, we
could distinguish the outline of what appeared to be a great
quadruped, of reddish hue, the aspect of which, however, as near
as we could judge, was by no means so ferocious as its
voice.&nbsp; We ventured to advance towards it, but as we
advanced, it retreated.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba, whose eyes were very
sharp, and accustomed to the desert, assured us that the creature
was either a dog or a stray calf.</p>
<p>Our animals were, at the very least, as absorbed with the
subject as ourselves.&nbsp; The horse and the mule pointed their
ears, and dug up the earth with their hoofs, while the camels,
with outstretched necks and glaring eyes, did not for an instant
remove their gaze from the spot whence these wild cries
issued.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain precisely with what creature we had to
do, we diluted a handful of meal in a wooden dish, and placing
this at the entrance of the tent, withdrew inside.&nbsp; Soon we
saw the animal slowly advance, then stop, then advance
again.&nbsp; At last it came to the dish, and with the most
remarkable rapidity, lapped up the supper we had prepared for
it.&nbsp; We now saw that it was a dog of immense size.&nbsp;
After having thoroughly licked and polished the empty dish, it
lay down, without ceremony, at the entrance of the tent; and we
forthwith followed its example, glad to have found a protector in
the apprehended foe.</p>
<p>Next morning, upon awaking, we were able to examine at leisure
the dog which, after having so alarmed us, had so unreservedly
attached itself to us.&nbsp; Its colour was red, its size
immense; its excessive meagreness showed that it had been
wandering about <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>homeless for some time past.&nbsp; A
dislocated leg, which it dragged along the ground, communicated
to it a sort of swinging motion, which added to its formidable
effect.&nbsp; But it was especially alarming when it sent forth
its loud, fierce voice.&nbsp; Whenever we heard it, we
instinctively looked at the animal whence it proceeded, to see
whether it really belonged to the canine race.</p>
<p>We resumed our route, and the new Arsalan accompanied us, its
general position being a few paces in advance of the caravan, as
though to show us the way, with which it appeared to be tolerably
familiar.</p>
<p>After two days&rsquo; journey we reached the foot of a chain
of mountains, the summits of which were lost in the clouds.&nbsp;
We set about ascending them, however, courageously, for we hoped
that beyond them we should find the Yellow River.&nbsp; That
day&rsquo;s journey was very painful, especially to the camels,
for every step was upon sharp, rugged rock; and their feet,
accordingly, were very speedily bleeding.&nbsp; We ourselves,
however, were too absorbed with the strange, fantastic aspect of
the mountains we were traversing to think of the toil they
occasioned us.</p>
<p>In the hollows and chasms of the precipices formed by these
lofty mountains, you see nothing but great heaps of mica and
laminated stones, broken, bruised, and in some cases absolutely
pulverised.&nbsp; This wreck of slate and schist must have been
brought into these abysses by some deluge, for it in no way
belongs to the mountains themselves, which are of granite.&nbsp;
As you approach the summits, the mountains assume forms more and
more fantastic.&nbsp; You see great heaps of rock piled one upon
the other, and apparently cemented together.&nbsp; These rocks
are almost entirely encrusted with shells and the remains of a
plant resembling sea weed; but that which is most remarkable is
that these granitic masses are cut and torn and worn in every
direction, presenting a ramification of holes and cavities,
meandering in a thousand complicated turns and twists, so that
you might imagine all the upper portion of each mountain to have
been subjected to the slow and destructive action of immense
worms.&nbsp; Sometimes in the granite you find deep impressions,
that seem the moulds of monsters, whose forms they still closely
retain.</p>
<p>As we gazed upon all these phenomena, it seemed to us that we
were travelling in the bed of some exhausted ocean.&nbsp;
Everything tended to the belief that these mountains had
undergone the gradual action of the sea.&nbsp; It is impossible
to attribute all you see there to the influence of mere rain, or
still less to the inundations of the Yellow River, which, however
prodigious they may be, can never have attained so great an
elevation.&nbsp; The geologists who affirm <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>that the
deluge took place by sinking, and not by a depolarization of the
earth, might probably find in these mountains good arguments in
favour of their system.</p>
<p>On reaching the crest of these mountains we saw beneath us the
Yellow River, rolling its waves majestically from south to
north.&nbsp; It was now near noon, and we hoped that same evening
to pass the river, and sleep in one of the inns of the little
town of Che-Tsui-Dze, which we perceived on the slope of a hill
beyond the river.</p>
<p>We occupied the whole afternoon in descending the rugged
mountain, selecting as we went, the places right and left that
seemed more practicable than the rest.&nbsp; At length we
arrived, and before nightfall, on the banks of the Yellow River,
our passage across which was most successfully effected.&nbsp; In
the first place, the Mongol Tartars who rented the ferry
oppressed our purse less direfully than the Chinese ferry-men had
done.&nbsp; Next, the animals got into the boat without any
difficulty.&nbsp; The only grievance was that we had to leave our
lame dog on the bank, for the Mongols would not admit it on any
terms, insisting upon the rule that all dogs must swim across the
river, the boat being destined solely for men, or for animals
that cannot swim.&nbsp; We were fain to submit to the
prejudice.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Yellow River we found ourselves in
China, and bade adieu for awhile to Tartary, to the desert, and
to the nomadic life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Sketch of the Tartar Nations.</p>
<p>The Tartars, descended from the ancient Scythians, have
preserved to this day the dexterity of their ancestors in archery
and horsemanship.&nbsp; The early part of their history is veiled
in obscurity, enveloped as they are by the wonders and prodigies
of the exploits of their first conqueror, Okhous-Han, who seems
to be the Madyes of Herodotus.&nbsp; This illustrious leader of
the Scythian hordes carried his arms into Syria, and reached even
the confines of Egypt.</p>
<p>The Chinese annals frequently mention certain nomad tribes,
which they call Hioung-Nou, and which are no other than the
Huns.&nbsp; These wandering and warlike tribes gradually extended
themselves, and finished by covering the immense deserts of
Tartary from east to west.&nbsp; Thenceforward they made
continual incursions on their neighbours, and on several
occasions made <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>attacks on the frontiers of the
empire.&nbsp; It was on such an occasion that Thsin-Chi-Hoang-Ti
had the Great Wall built in the year 213 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>&nbsp; About 134 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Huns, under the conduct of
Lao-Chan, their emperor, made an attack on the Tartars Youei-Tchi
(the Get&aelig;), who dwelt on the confines of the province of
Chen-Si.&nbsp; After a series of long and terrible conflicts,
Lao-Chan defeated them, slew their chief, and made of his head a
drinking cup, which he wore suspended from his girdle.&nbsp; The
Get&aelig; did not choose to submit to the victors, and preferred
going elsewhere in search of another country.&nbsp; They divided
into two principal bands.&nbsp; One advanced towards the
north-west, and took possession of the plains situated upon the
banks of the river Ili, beyond the glaciers of the Moussour
mountains; this is that part of Tartary which is now called the
Tourgout.&nbsp; The other division marched southwards, associated
with it in its course several other tribes, and reached the
regions watered by the Indus.&nbsp; There it laid waste the
kingdom founded by the successors of Alexander, strove for some
time against the Parthians, and finished by establishing itself
in Bactriana.&nbsp; The Greeks called these Tartar tribes
Indo-Scythians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile divisions arose among the Huns; and the Chinese,
ever politic and cunning, took advantage of this circumstance to
enfeeble them.&nbsp; Towards the year 48 of our era, the Tartar
empire was divided into northern and southern.&nbsp; Under the
dynasty of Han, the Northern Huns were completely defeated by the
Chinese armies.&nbsp; They were obliged to abandon the regions
wherein they had settled, and proceeded in large numbers towards
the west, to the borders of the Caspian Sea; here they spread
themselves over the countries watered by the Volga, and round the
Palus M&aelig;otis.</p>
<p>They commenced in 376 their formidable irruptions upon the
Roman empire.&nbsp; They began by subduing the territory of the
Alani, a nomad and pastoral people like themselves; some of these
sought refuge in the Circassian mountains, others migrated
further west, and finally settled on the shores of the
Danube.&nbsp; Later, they drove before them the Suevi, the Goths,
the Gepid&aelig;, and the Vandals, and with these advanced to
ravage Germany, in the beginning of the fifth century.&nbsp;
These large hordes of barbarians resembling waves, one driven on
by the other, thus formed, in their destructive course, a fearful
torrent, which finally inundated Europe.</p>
<p>The Southern Huns, who had remained in Tartary, were for a
long time weakened by the dispersion of their northern
countrymen; but they recovered, by insensible degrees, and again
became terrible to the Chinese; though they did not acquire a
political and historical importance till the time of the famous
Tchinggiskhan, towards the close of the twelfth century.</p>
<p><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>The power of the Tartars, long confined within the
desert steppes of Mongolia, broke at length its bounds, and
innumerable armies might be seen descending from the lofty
table-lands of Central Asia, and precipitating themselves with
fury on horrified nations: Tchinggiskhan carried pillage and
death even to the most remote regions.&nbsp; China, Tartary,
India, Persia, Syria, Muscovy, Poland, Hungary,
Austria,&mdash;all these countries successively felt the terrible
blows of the victorious Tartar.&nbsp; France, Italy, and the
other regions further west, escaped with their fear.</p>
<p>In the year 1260 of our era, Khan-Khoubilai, grandson of
Tchinggis, who had commenced the conquest of China, succeeded in
subduing that vast empire.&nbsp; It was the first time that it
had passed under the yoke of foreigners.&nbsp; Khoubilai died at
Peking in the year 1294, aged eighty.&nbsp; His empire was,
without dispute, the largest that had ever existed.&nbsp; Chinese
geographers state that, under the Mongol dynasty of the Youen,
the empire northwards went beyond the In-Chan mountains;
westwards it extended beyond the Gobi or sandy desert; to the
east, it was terminated by the countries situated on the left of
the river Siao; and in the southern direction it reached the
shores of the You&eacute; Sea.&nbsp; It is obvious that this
description does not include the countries tributary to the
empire.&nbsp; Thibet, Turkestan, Muscovy, Siam, Cochin China,
Tonking, and Corea, acknowledged the supremacy of the Grand Khan
of the Tartars, and faithfully paid him tribute.&nbsp; Even
European nations were, from time to time, insolently summoned to
acknowledge the Mongol supremacy.&nbsp; Haughty and threatening
letters were sent to the Pope, to the King of France, to the
Emperor, commanding them to send as tribute the revenues of their
states to the depths of Tartary.&nbsp; The descendants of
Tchinggiskhan, who reigned in Muscovy, Persia, Bactriana, and
Sogdiana, received investiture from the Emperor of Peking, and
undertook nothing of importance without first giving him
notice.&nbsp; The diplomatic papers which the King of Persia
sent, in the thirteenth century, to Philip the Fair, are a proof
of this dependance.&nbsp; On these precious monuments, which are
preserved to this day in the archives of France, are seals in
Chinese characters, which testify the supremacy of the Grand Khan
of Peking over the sovereigns of Persia.</p>
<p>The conquests of Tchinggiskhan and of his successors; and, in
later times, those of Tamerlan or Timour, which transferred the
seat of the Mongol empire to Samarcand, contributed, in as great,
and perhaps a greater degree than the Crusades, to renew the
intercourse of Europe with the most distant states of the East,
and favoured the discoveries which have been so useful to the
progress of the arts, of the sciences, and of navigation.</p>
<p><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>On this subject, we will quote in this place, an
interesting passage from the Memoirs which M. Abel R&eacute;musat
published in 1824, on the political relations of the Christian
princes, and particularly of the Kings of France with the Mongol
Emperors:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lieutenants of Tchinggiskhan, and of
his first successors, on arriving in Western Asia, did not seek
at first, to contract any alliance there.&nbsp; The princes,
whose domains they entered, silently permitted the impost of a
tribute; the rest were required to submit.&nbsp; The Georgians
and Armenians were among the first.&nbsp; The Franks of Syria,
the Kings of Hungary, the Emperor himself, had to repel their
insolent demands.&nbsp; The Pope was not exempted, by the
supremacy he enjoyed in relation to the other Christian princes;
nor the King of France, by the high renown he enjoyed throughout
the East.&nbsp; The terror which the Tartars inspired, precluded
a fitting answer to their demands.&nbsp; The course resorted to
was conciliation, the seeking their alliance, and the
endeavouring to rouse them against the Moslems.&nbsp; The latter
attempt would scarcely have been successful, had not the
Christians in the East, who, by adhesion as vassals, had obtained
credit at the courts of their generals and their princes,
zealously employed themselves in the matter.&nbsp; The Mongols
were induced at last to undertake war against the Sultan of
Egypt.&nbsp; Such were the relations with this nation during the
first period, which lasted from 1224 to 1262.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second period, the Khalifat was destroyed; a
Mongol principality was founded in Persia: it bordered on the
states of the Sultan of Egypt.&nbsp; A sanguinary rivalry arose
between the two countries, which the Eastern Christians did all
in their power to irritate.&nbsp; The Mongol empire was
divided.&nbsp; Those of Persia had need of auxiliaries, which
their Armenian vassals procured for them: these auxiliaries were
the Franks.&nbsp; From this time, their power declined more and
more; and ere long it was annihilated.&nbsp; Fresh crusades might
restore it.&nbsp; The Mongols excited these in the West.&nbsp;
They joined their exhortations to those of the Georgians,
Armenians, of the wreck of the crusaders, who had taken refuge in
Cyprus, and to those of the sovereign pontiffs.&nbsp; The first
Tartars had commenced by threats; the last came to offers, and
even descended to supplications.&nbsp; Twenty ambassadors were
sent by them to Italy, France, and England; and it was no fault
of theirs that the fire of the holy wars was not rekindled, and
extended over Europe and Asia.&nbsp; These diplomatic attempts,
the recital of which forms, so to speak, an epilogue to the
transmarine expeditions, scarcely noticed by those who have
written their history, and, indeed, unknown to most of them,
would deserve, perhaps, our fixed attention.&nbsp; We should have
to collect facts, resolve difficulties, <!-- page 241--><a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>and place
in a clear point of view the political system to which the
negociations with the Tartars belong.&nbsp; Specialties of this
class could not be appreciated, whilst they were considered
isolately, and without examining them one with another.&nbsp; We
might doubt, with Voltaire and De Guignes, that a king of the
Tartars had met Saint Louis with offers of service.&nbsp; This
fact might seem not tenable, and its recital paradoxical.&nbsp;
Yet such scepticism would be unreasonable, after we had seen that
the Mongols had acted upon that principle for fifty years; and
when we are assured, by reading contemporary writings, and by the
inspection of original monuments, that this conduct was natural
on their part, that it entered into their views, that it
conformed to their interests, and that it is explained by the
common rules of reason and policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The series of events which are connected with these
negociations serves to complete the history of the Crusades; but
the part they may have had in the great moral revolution, which
soon followed the relations which they occasioned between people
hitherto unknown to each other, are facts of an importance more
general and still more worthy of our particular attention.&nbsp;
Two systems of civilization had become established at the two
extremities of the ancient continent, as the effect of
independent causes, without communication, and consequently
without mutual influence.&nbsp; All at once the events of war and
political combinations bring into contact these two great bodies,
long strangers to each other.&nbsp; The formal interviews of
ambassadors are not the only occasions which brought them
together.&nbsp; Other occasions more private, but also more
efficacious, were established by imperceptible, but innumerable
ramifications, by the travels of a host of individuals, attracted
to the two extremities of the earth, with commercial views, in
the train of ambassadors or armies.&nbsp; The irruption of the
Mongols, by throwing everything into agitation, neutralized
distance, filled up intervals, and brought the nations together;
the events of war transported millions of individuals to an
immense distance from the places where they were born.&nbsp;
History has recorded the voyages of kings, of ambassadors, of
missionaries.&nbsp; Sempad, the Orbelian; Hayton, King of
Armenia; the two Davids, Kings of Georgia; and several others
were led by political motives to the depths of Asia.&nbsp;
Yeroslaf, Grand Duke of Sousdal and vassal of the Mongols, like
the other Russian princes, came to Kara-Koroum, where he died of
poison, it was said, administered by the Empress herself, the
mother of the Emperor Gayouk.&nbsp; Many monks, Italians, French,
Flemings, were charged with diplomatic missions to the Grand
Khan.&nbsp; Mongols of distinction came to Rome, Barcelona,
Valencia, Lyons, Paris, London, Northampton; and a Franciscan of
the kingdom of Naples <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>was Archbishop of Peking.&nbsp; His
successor was a professor of theology of the Faculty of
Paris.&nbsp; But how many others, less celebrated, were led in
the train of those men, either as slaves, or impelled by the
desire of gain, or by curiosity, to countries hitherto
unexplored.&nbsp; Chance has preserved the names of a few.&nbsp;
The first envoy who came on the part of the Tartars to the King
of Hungary was an Englishman, banished from his country for
certain crimes, and who, after having wandered throughout Asia,
had finally taken service among the Mongols.&nbsp; A Flemish
Cordelier met in the depth of Tartary a woman of Metz, named
Paquette, who had been carried away from Hungary, a Parisian
goldsmith whose brother was established in Paris on the Grand
Pont, and a young man from the environs of Rouen, who had been
present at the capture of Belgrade; he saw there also Russians,
Hungarians, and Flemings.&nbsp; A singer, named Robert, after
travelling through the whole of Eastern Asia, returned to find a
grave in the Cathedral of Chartres.&nbsp; A Tartar was a
helmet-maker in the armies of Philip the Fair.&nbsp; Jean de
Plan-Carpin met, near Gayouk, with a Russian gentleman, whom he
calls Temer, who served as interpreter.&nbsp; Several merchants
of Breslau, Poland, and Austria, accompanied him in his journey
to Tartary; others returned with him through Russia; these were
Genoese, Pisans, and two merchants of Venice whom chance had
brought to Bokhara.&nbsp; They were induced to go in the suite of
a Mongol ambassador, whom Houlagou had sent to Khoubilai.&nbsp;
They sojourned several years in China and Tartary, took letters
from the Grand Khan to the Pope, and returned to the Grand Khan,
bringing with them the son of one of their number, the celebrated
Marco-Polo, and quitted once more the Court of Khoubilai to
return to Venice.&nbsp; Travels of this kind were not less
frequent in the succeeding age.&nbsp; Of this number are those of
John de Mandeville, an English physician; of Oderic of Friuli; of
Pegoletti; of Guillaume de Boutdeselle, and several others.&nbsp;
We may be certain that the journeys which have been recorded are
but a small portion of those which were performed, and that there
were at that period more people able to make a long journey than
to write an account of it.&nbsp; Many of these adventurers must
have established themselves and died in the countries they went
to visit.&nbsp; Others returned to their country as obscure as
when they left it; but with their imaginations full of what they
had seen, relating it all to their families and friends, and
doubtless with exaggerations; but leaving around them, amidst
ridiculous fables, a few useful recollections and traditions
productive of advantage.&nbsp; Thus were sown in Germany, in
Italy, in France, in the monasteries, among the nobility, and
even in the lowest grades of society, precious seeds <!-- page
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>destined to bud at a later period.&nbsp; All these
obscure travellers, carrying the arts of their native country to
distant lands, brought back other information about these no less
precious, and thus effected, unconsciously, exchanges more
productive of good than all those of commerce.&nbsp; By this
means not merely the traffic in silks, in porcelains, in
commodities from Hindostan, was made more extensive and more
practicable, opening new routes to industry and commerce; but,
that which was far more valuable, foreign manners and customs of
before unknown nations, extraordinary productions, were presented
to the European mind, confined, since the fall of the Roman
empire, within too narrow a circle.&nbsp; Men began to have an
idea that, after all, there was something worthy of notice in the
finest, the most populous and the most anciently civilized of the
four quarters of the world.&nbsp; People began to think of
studying the arts, the religions, the languages of the nations
who inhabited it, and there was even a proposition to establish a
professorship of the Tartar language in the University of
Paris.&nbsp; Romantic narratives, reduced by discussion within
reasonable proportions, diffused in all directions juster and
more varied information: the world seemed opening towards the
East.&nbsp; Geography made immense strides, and ardour of
discovery became the new form assumed by the adventurous spirit
of Europeans.&nbsp; The idea of another hemisphere ceased, as
soon as our own became better known, to present itself to the
mind as a paradox destitute of all probability, and it was in
going in search of the Zipangri of Marco-Polo that Christopher
Columbus discovered the New World.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should make too great a digression, were I to
investigate what were in the East the effects of the Mongol
irruption, the destruction of the Khalifat, the extermination of
the Bulgarians, of the Romans, and other northern nations.&nbsp;
The decline of the population of Upper Asia, so favourable to the
reaction by which the Russians, hitherto the vassals of the
Tartars, subdued in their turn all the nomads of the North; the
submission of China to a foreign yoke; the definitive
establishment of the Indian religion in Thibet and Tartary; all
these events deserve to be studied in detail.&nbsp; I will not
even pause to inquire what might have been the results, to the
nations of Eastern Asia, of the intercourse which they had with
the West.&nbsp; The introduction of the Indian numerals into
China, a knowledge of the astronomical system of the Moslems, the
translation of the New Testament and the Psalms into the Mongol
language, executed by the Latin Archbishop of <i>Khan Balik</i>
(Peking), the foundation of the lamanical hierarchy, framed in
imitation of the pontifical court, and produced by the fusion
effected between the remnants of the Nestorianism established in
<!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>Tartary and the dogmas of the Buddhists; such were all
the innovations of which there are any traces in Eastern Asia,
and therewith the commerce of the Franks has very little to
do.&nbsp; The Asiatics are punished for their contempt of the
knowledge of Europeans, by the limited results which that very
scorn enables them to derive from it.&nbsp; To confine myself to
what concerns the people of the West, and to attempt to justify
what I said at the commencement of this Memoir, that the effects
of the communications with the nations of Upper Asia, in the
thirteenth century, had contributed indirectly to the progress of
European civilization, I will conclude with a reflection, which I
shall offer with the more confidence, that it is not entirely
new, while, at the same time, the facts we have just investigated
seem calculated to give it a sanction it had not before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the establishment of the intercourse which,
first the Crusades, and then, later, the irruption of the
Mongols, caused to spring up between the nations of the East and
those of the West, the greater part of those inventions, which
distinguished the close of the middle ages, had been known to the
Asiatics for centuries.&nbsp; The polarity of the loadstone had
been discovered and put into operation in China from the remotest
antiquity.&nbsp; Gunpowder had been as long known to the Hindoos
and the Chinese, the latter of whom had, in the tenth century,
&lsquo;thunder carriages,&rsquo; which seem to have been
cannon.&nbsp; It is difficult to account in any other way for the
fire-stone throwers, which are so often mentioned in the history
of the Mongols.&nbsp; Houlagou, when he set out for Persia, had
in his army a body of Chinese artillerymen.&nbsp; Again, the
first edition of the classic books engraved on wooden boards is
dated in the year 952.&nbsp; The institution of bank notes, and
of banking and exchange offices, took place among the Jou-Tchen
in 1154.&nbsp; Bank notes were adopted by the Mongols established
in China; they were known to the Persians by the same name as the
Chinese give them, and Josaphat Barbaro was informed in 1450 by
an intelligent Tartar whom he met at Asof, and who had been on an
embassy to China, that this sort of money was printed in China
every year <i>con nuova stampa</i>; and this expression is
remarkable enough, considering the time when Barbaro made this
observation.&nbsp; Lastly, playing cards&mdash;into the origin of
which so many learned antiquarians would not have busied
themselves to inquire, were it not that it marked one of the
first applications of the art of engraving on wood&mdash;were
invented in China in the year 1120.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, besides, in the commencement of each of
these inventions, particular features which seem calculated to
show their <!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>origin.&nbsp; I will not speak of
the compass, the ancient use of which, in China, Hager seems to
me successfully to have demonstrated, and which passed into
Europe by means of the Crusades, previous to the irruption of the
Mongols, as the famous passage in Jacques de Vitry, and some
others, prove.&nbsp; But the oldest playing cards, those used in
the <i>jeu de tarots</i>, have a marked analogy in their form,
their designs, their size, their number, with the cards which the
Chinese make use of.&nbsp; Cannons were the first firearms made
use of in Europe; they are also, it would appear, the only
fire-arms with which the Chinese were acquainted at this
period.&nbsp; The question as to paper money appears to have been
viewed in its true light by M. Langles, and after him by
Hager.&nbsp; The first boards made use of to print upon were made
of wood and stereotyped, like those of the Chinese; and nothing
is more natural than to suppose that some book from China gave
the idea.&nbsp; This would not be more surprising than the
fragment of the Bible, in Gothic characters, which Father Martini
discovered in the house of a Chinese at Tchang-Tcheou-Fou.&nbsp;
We have the instance of another usage, which evidently followed
the same route&mdash;it is that of the Souan-Pan, or arithmetical
machine of the Chinese, which was, doubtless, introduced into
Europe by the Tartars of the army of Batou, and which has so
extensively pervaded Russia and Poland, that women who cannot
read use nothing else in the settlement of their household
accounts, and their little commercial dealings.&nbsp; The
conjecture which gives a Chinese origin to the primitive idea of
European typography is so natural, that it was propounded before
there was any opportunity for collecting together all the
circumstances which make it so probable.&nbsp; It is the idea of
Paulo Jovio, and of Mendo&ccedil;a, who imagine that a Chinese
book may have been brought into Europe before the arrival of the
Portuguese in the Indies, by the medium of the Scythians and
Muscovites.&nbsp; It was developed by an anonymous Englishman;
and carefully putting aside from the consideration the impression
in moveable types, which is, no doubt, an invention peculiar to
the Europeans, one cannot conceive any sound objection to an
hypothesis which bears so strongly the stamp of
probability.&nbsp; But this supposition acquires a still greater
degree of probability when we apply it to the totality of the
discoveries in question.&nbsp; All were made in Eastern Asia; all
were unheard-of in the West.&nbsp; Communication took place: it
was continued for a century and a-half, and ere another century
had elapsed, all these inventions were known in Europe.&nbsp;
Their origin is veiled in obscurity.&nbsp; The region where they
manifested themselves, the men who produced them, are equally a
subject of doubt.&nbsp; Enlightened countries were not their
theatre.&nbsp; It was not learned men who <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>were their
authors; it was common men, obscure artisans, who lighted up, one
after another, these unexpected flames.&nbsp; Nothing can better
demonstrate the effects of a communication; nothing can be more
in accordance with what we have said above as to those invisible
channels, those imperceptible ramifications, whereby the science
of the Eastern nations penetrated into Europe.&nbsp; The greater
part of these inventions appear at first in the state of infancy
in which the Asiatics have left them; and this circumstance
alone, almost prevents our having any doubt as to their
origin.&nbsp; Some are immediately put in practice; others remain
for some time enveloped in obscurity, which conceals from us
their progress, and they are taken, on their appearance, for new
discoveries; all are soon brought to perfection, and, as it were,
fecundated by the genius of Europeans, operating in concert,
communicate to human intelligence the greatest impulse known to
history.&nbsp; Thus, by this shock of nations, the darkness of
the middle age was dispersed.&nbsp; Calamities, which at first
aspect seemed merely destined to afflict mankind, served to
arouse it from the lethargy in which it had remained for ages;
and the subversion of twenty empires was the price at which
Providence accorded to Europe the light of modern
civilization.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mongol dynasty of the Youen occupied the empire for a
century.&nbsp; After having shone with a brilliancy, the
reflection of which spread over the most remote regions, it ended
with Chun-Ti, a feeble prince, more mindful of frivolous
amusements than of the great inheritance which had been left him
by his ancestors.&nbsp; The Chinese regained their independence;
and Tchou-Youen-Tchang, the son of a labourer, and for some time
a servant in a convent of bonzes, was the founder of the
celebrated dynasty of the Ming.&nbsp; They ascended the imperial
throne in 1368, and reigned in the name of Houng-Wou.</p>
<p>The Tartars were massacred in great numbers in the interior of
China, and the rest were driven back to their old country.&nbsp;
The Emperor Young-Lo pursued them three several times beyond the
desert, more than 200 leagues north of the Great Wall, in order
to exterminate them.&nbsp; He could not, however, effect this
object, and, dying on his return from his third expedition, his
successors left the Tartars in peace beyond the desert, whence
they diffused themselves right and left.&nbsp; The principal
chiefs of the blood of Tchinggiskhan occupied, each with his
people, a particular district, and gave birth to various tribes,
which all formed so many petty kingdoms.</p>
<p>These fallen princes, ever tormented by the recollection of
their ancient power, appeared several times on the frontiers of
the empire, <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>and did not cease to disquiet the
Chinese princes, without, however, succeeding in their attempts
at invasion.</p>
<p>Towards the commencement of the seventeenth century, the
Mantchou Tartars having made themselves masters of China, the
Mongols gradually submitted to them, and placed themselves under
their sovereignty.&nbsp; The Oelets, a Mongol tribe, deriving
their name from Oloutai, a celebrated warrior in the fourteenth
century, made frequent irruptions into the country of the
Khalkhas, and a sanguinary war arose between these two
people.&nbsp; The Emperor Khang-Hi, under the pretence of
conciliating them, intervened in their quarrel, put an end to the
war by subjecting both parties, and extended his domination in
Tartary to the frontiers of Russia; the three Khans of the
Khalkhas came to make their submission to the Mantchou Emperor,
who convoked a grand meeting near Tolon-Noor.&nbsp; Each Khan
presented to him eight white horses, and one white camel; from
which circumstance this tribute was called, in the Mongol
language, <i>Yousoun-Dchayan</i>, (the nine white); it was agreed
that they should bring every year a similar present.</p>
<p>At the present time the Tartar nations, more or less subject
to the sway of the Mantchou emperors, are no longer what they
were in the time of Tchinggiskhan and Timour.&nbsp; Since that
epoch Tartary has been disorganized by so many revolutions; it
has undergone such notable political and geographical changes,
that what travellers and writers said about it in former periods
no longer applies to it.</p>
<p>During a length of time geographers divided Tartary into three
grand parts&mdash;1.&nbsp; Russian Tartary, extending from east
to west, from the sea of Kamchatka to the Black Sea, and from
north to south, from the regions inhabited by the Tongous and
Samoiede tribes, to the lakes Baikal and Aral.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;
Chinese Tartary, bounded east by the sea of Japan, south by the
Great Wall of China, west by the Gobi or great sandy desert; and
north, by the Baikal Lake.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Independent Tartary,
extending to the Caspian Sea, and including in its limits the
whole of Thibet.&nbsp; Such a division is altogether chimerical,
and without any sound basis.&nbsp; All these immense tracts,
indeed, once formed part of the great empires of Tchinggiskhan
and Timour.&nbsp; The Tartar hordes made encampments there at
their will in the course of their warlike wanderings; but now all
this is completely changed, and, to form an exact idea of modern
Tartary, it is necessary to modify in a great degree the notions
that have been transmitted to us by the medi&aelig;val authors,
and which, in default of better information, have been adopted by
all the geographers, down to Malte-Brun, inclusive.&nbsp; To
realize a definite <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>idea about Tartary, we think that
the clearest, most certain, and consequently the most reasonable
rule, is to adopt the opinions of the Tartars themselves, and of
the Chinese, far more competent judges of this matter than
Europeans, who, having no connection with this part of Asia, are
obliged to trust to conjectures which have often little to do
with truth.&nbsp; In accordance with a universal usage, the
soundness of which we were enabled to confirm in the course of
our travels, we will divide the Tartar people into Eastern
Tartars (Toung-Ta-Dze), or Mantchous, and Western Tartars
(Si-Ta-Dze), or Mongols.&nbsp; The boundaries of Mantchouria are
very distinct, as we have already stated.&nbsp; It is bounded on
the north by the Kinggan mountains, which separate it from
Siberia; on the south by the gulf of Phou-Hai and Corea; on the
east by the sea of Japan; and on the west by the Barrier of
Stakes and a branch of the Sakhalien-Oula.&nbsp; It would be a
difficult matter to define the limits of Mongolia in an equally
exact manner; however, without any serious departure from the
truth, we may include them between the 75th and the 118th degrees
longitude of Paris, and 85th and 50th degrees of north
latitude.&nbsp; Great and Little Boukaria, Kalmoukia, Great and
Little Thibet&mdash;all these denominations seem to us purely
imaginary.&nbsp; We shall enter, by-and-by, into some details on
this subject, in the second part of our travels, when we come to
speak of Thibet and of the neighbouring people.</p>
<p>The people who are comprised in the grand division of
Mongolia, that we have just given, are not all to be
indiscriminately considered as Mongols.&nbsp; There are some of
them to whom this denomination can only be applied in a
restricted sense.&nbsp; Towards the north-west, for instance, the
Mongols are frequently confounded with the Moslems; and towards
the south, with the Si-Fans, or Eastern Thibetians.&nbsp; The
best way clearly to distinguish these people, is to pay attention
to their language, their manners, their religion, their costume,
and particularly to the name by which they designate
themselves.&nbsp; The Mongol Khalkhas are the most numerous, the
most wealthy, and the most celebrated in history.&nbsp; They
occupy the entire north of Mongolia.&nbsp; Their country is of
vast extent, including nearly 200 leagues from north to south,
and about 500 from east to west.&nbsp; We will not repeat here
what we have already said about the Khalkha district; we will
merely add that it is divided into four great provinces, subject
to four separate sovereigns.&nbsp; These provinces are
sub-divided into eighty-four banners, in Chinese called Ky, in
Mongol Bochkhon.&nbsp; Princes of different ranks are at the head
of each banner.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the authority of these
secular princes, it may safely be said that the Khalkhas are all
dependent on the Guison-Tamba, the Grand Lama, the Living <!--
page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>Buddha of all the Mongol Khalkhas, who consider it an
honour to call themselves Disciples of the Holy One of Kouren
(<i>Kour&eacute; bokte ain Chabi</i>).</p>
<p>The Southern Mongols have no special designation; they merely
bear the name of the principality to which they belong.&nbsp;
Thus they say, &ldquo;Mongol of Souniout, Mongol of
Gechekten,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Southern Mongolia comprises
twenty-five principalities, which, like those of the Khalkhas,
are sub-divided into several Bochkhon.&nbsp; The principal are
the Ortous, the two Toumet, the two Souniout, the Tchakar,
Karatsin Oungniot, Gechekten, Barin, Nayman, and the country of
the Eleuts.</p>
<p>The Southern Mongols, near the Great Wall, have little
modified their manners by their constant intercourse with the
Chinese.&nbsp; You may remark sometimes in their dress a sort of
studied elegance, and in their character pretensions to the
refined politeness of the Chinese.&nbsp; Laying aside, on the one
hand, the frankness, the good-natured openness of the Mongols of
the North, they have borrowed from their neighbours somewhat of
their cunning and foppery.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the South-east, we encounter the Mongols of the
Koukou-Noor or Blue Lake (in Chinese, Tsing-Hai or Blue
Sea).&nbsp; This country is far from possessing the extent which
is generally assigned to it in geographical charts.&nbsp; The
Mongols of the Koukou-Noor only dwell around the lake, from which
they derive their name; and, moreover, they are mixed up to a
great extent with Si-Fans, who cannot live secure in their own
country, because of the hordes of robbers that are constantly
ravaging it.</p>
<p>To the west of the Koukou-Noor is the river Tsaidam, on whose
banks encamp the numerous tribes, called Tsaidam-Mongols, who
must not be confounded with the Mongols of the Koukou-Noor.&nbsp;
Farther still, in the very heart of Thibet, we encounter other
Mongol tribes.&nbsp; We shall say nothing about them here, as we
shall have occasion to speak of them in the course of our
narrative.&nbsp; We will revert, therefore, in some detail to the
Mongols of the Koukou-Noor and the Tsaidam.</p>
<p>The Torgot-Tartars, who formerly dwelt near Kara-Koroum, the
capital of the Mongols in the time of Tchinggiskhan, are now
situated to the north-west of Mongolia.&nbsp; In 1672, the whole
tribe, having raised their tents and assembled all their flocks,
abandoned the district which had served them as a resting-place,
migrated to the western part of Asia, and established themselves
in the steppes between the Don and the Volga.</p>
<p>The Torgot princes recognised the sovereignty of the Muscovite
emperors, and declared themselves their vassals.&nbsp; But these
<!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>wandering hordes, passionately attached to the
independence of their nomad life, could not long accommodate
themselves to the new masters they had selected.&nbsp; They soon
felt an aversion to the laws and regular institutions which were
becoming established in the Russian empire.&nbsp; In 1770, the
Torgots again made a general migration.&nbsp; Led by their chief,
Aboucha, they suddenly disappeared, passed the Russian frontiers,
and halted on the banks of the river Ili.&nbsp; This flight had
been concerted with the government of Peking.&nbsp; The Emperor
of China, who had been informed beforehand of the period of their
departure, took them under his protection, and assigned to them
settlements on the banks of the Ili.</p>
<p>The principality of Ili is now the Botany-Bay of China:
thither are sent the Chinese criminals, condemned to exile by the
laws of the empire.&nbsp; Before their arrival in these distant
regions they are obliged to cross frightful deserts, and to climb
the Moussour (glacier) mountains.&nbsp; These gigantic summits
are entirely formed of icebergs, piled one on the top of the
other, so that travellers cannot advance except by hewing steps
out of the eternal ice.&nbsp; On the other side of the Moussour
mountains the country, they say, is magnificent; the climate
temperate enough, and the soil adapted for every kind of
cultivation.&nbsp; The exiles have transported thither a great
many of the productions of China; but the Mongols continue to
follow their nomad life, and merely to pasture herds and
flocks.</p>
<p>We had occasion to travel for some time with Lamas of the
Torgot; some of them arrived with us at Lha-Ssa.&nbsp; We did not
remark, either in their costume, in their manners, or in their
language, anything to distinguish them from the Mongols.&nbsp;
They spoke a good deal about the <i>Oros</i> (Russians), but in a
way to make us understand that they were by no means desirous of
again becoming subject to their sway.&nbsp; The Torgot camels are
remarkably fine, and generally much larger and stronger than
those in the other parts of Mongolia.</p>
<p>It would be a very desirable thing to send missionaries to
Ili.&nbsp; We believe that there would be found already formed
there a numerous and fervent body of Christians.&nbsp; It is well
known that for many years past, it is hither that the Christians
who have refused to apostatize, have been exiled from all the
provinces of China.&nbsp; The missionary who should obtain
permission to exercise his zeal in the Torgot, would doubtless
have to undergo great privations during his journey thither; but
he would be amply compensated, by the thought of carrying the
succour of religion to all those generous confessors of the
faith, whom the tyranny of the Chinese government has sent to die
in these distant regions.</p>
<p>To the south-west of Torgot is the province of
Khachghar.&nbsp; At <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>the present day, this district
cannot at all be considered a part of Mongolia.&nbsp; Its
inhabitants have neither the language, nor the physiognomy, nor
the costume, nor the religion, nor the manners of the Mongols;
they are Moslems.&nbsp; The Chinese, as well as the Tartars, call
them Hoei-Hoei, a name by which they designate the Mussulmen who
dwell in the interior of the Chinese empire.&nbsp; This
description of Khachghar, is also applicable to the people to the
south of the Celestial Mountains, in the Chinese tongue called
Tien-Chan, and in Mongol, Bokte-oola (holy mountains).</p>
<p>Not long since the Chinese government had to sustain a
terrible war against Khachghar.&nbsp; We are indebted for the
following details to some military Mandarins who accompanied this
famous and distant expedition.</p>
<p>The Court of Peking kept in Khachghar two grand Mandarins,
with the title of Delegates Extraordinary (<i>Kintchai</i>), who
were charged to guard the frontiers, and to keep an eye on the
movements of the neighbouring people.&nbsp; These Chinese
officers, instead of merely watching, exercised their power with
such horrible and revolting tyranny, that they wore out the
patience of the people of Khachghar, who, at length, rose in a
body, and massacred all the Chinese resident in the
country.&nbsp; The news reaching Peking, the Emperor, who knew
nothing of the misconduct of his officers, assembled his troops,
and marched them against the Moslems.&nbsp; The contest was long
and bloody.&nbsp; The Chinese government had several times to
send reinforcements.&nbsp; The Hoei-Hoei were commanded by a hero
called Tchankoeul; his stature, they say, was prodigious, and he
had no weapon but an enormous club.&nbsp; He frequently defeated
the Chinese army, and destroyed several grand military
Mandarins.&nbsp; At length, the Emperor sent the famous Yang, who
put an end to the war.&nbsp; The conqueror of Khachghar is a
military Mandarin of the province of Chang-Tong, remarkable for
his lofty stature, and above all for the prodigious length of his
beard.&nbsp; According to the account we heard of him, his manner
of fighting was singular enough.&nbsp; As soon as the action
commenced, he tied up his beard in two great knots, in order that
it might not get in his way, and then he placed himself behind
his troops.&nbsp; There, armed with a long sabre, he drove his
soldiers on to combat, and massacred, without pity, those who
were cowards enough to draw back.&nbsp; This method of commanding
an army will seem somewhat peculiar; but those who have lived
among the Chinese will see that the military genius of Yang was
founded on a thorough knowledge of the soldiers he had to deal
with.</p>
<p>The Moslems were defeated, and Tchankoeul was, by means of
treachery, made a prisoner.&nbsp; He was conveyed to Peking,
where he <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>had to undergo the most barbarous
and humiliating treatment, even the being exposed to the people,
shut up in an iron cage, like a wild beast.&nbsp; The Emperor
Tao-Kouang wished to see this warrior, of whom fame spoke so
much, and ordered him to be brought to him.&nbsp; The Mandarins
immediately took alarm; they were afraid lest the prisoner should
reveal to the Emperor the causes which had brought about the
revolt of Khachghar, and the horrible massacres which had
followed it.&nbsp; The great dignitaries saw that these
revelations would be dangerous for them, and make them seem
guilty of negligence in the eyes of the Emperor, for not having
duly observed the conduct of the Mandarins who were placed in
charge of distant provinces.&nbsp; To obviate this danger, they
made the unfortunate Tchankouel swallow a draught which took away
his speech, and threw him into a disgusting state of
stupor.&nbsp; When he appeared in the presence of the Emperor,
his mouth, they say, foamed, and his visage was horrible; he
could not answer any of the questions which were addressed to
him.&nbsp; Tchankouel was condemned to be cut into pieces, and to
be served up as food for the dogs.</p>
<p>The Mandarin Yang was loaded with favours by the Emperor, for
having so happily terminated the war of Khachghar.&nbsp; He
obtained the dignity of Batourou, a Tartar word signifying
valorous.&nbsp; This title is the most honourable that a military
Mandarin can obtain.</p>
<p>The Batourou Yang was sent against the English, in their last
war with the Chinese; but there it would appear his tactics did
not avail.&nbsp; During our travels in China we inquired of
several Mandarins, how it was that the Batourou Yang had not
exterminated the English: the answer everywhere was, that he had
had compassion on them.</p>
<p>The numerous principalities of which Mongolia is composed, are
all more or less dependent on the Mantchou Emperor, in proportion
as they show more or less weakness in their relations with the
Court of Peking.&nbsp; They may be considered as so many feudal
kingdoms, giving no obedience to their sovereign beyond the
extent of their fear or their interest; and indeed, what the
Mantchou dynasty fears above all things, is the vicinity of these
Tartar tribes.&nbsp; The Emperors are fully aware that, headed by
an enterprising and bold chief, these tribes might successfully
renew the terrible wars of other times, and once more obtain
possession of the empire.&nbsp; For this reason, they use every
means in their power to preserve the friendship of the Mongol
princes, and to enfeeble the strength of these terrible
nomads.&nbsp; It is with this view, as we have already remarked,
that they patronise lamanism, by richly endowing the Lamaseries,
and by granting numerous privileges to the Lamas.&nbsp; <!-- page
253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>So
long as they can maintain their influence over the sacerdotal
tribe, they are assured that neither the people nor the princes
will stir from their repose.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p253.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

src="images/p253.jpg" />
</a>Alliances are another means by which the reigning dynasty
seeks to consolidate its power in Mongolia.&nbsp; The daughters
and nearest relations of the Emperor, intermarrying with the
royal families of Tartary, contribute to maintain between the two
peoples pacific and friendly relations.&nbsp; Yet these
princesses continue to have a great predilection for the pomp and
grandeur of the imperial court.&nbsp; The mournful, monotonous
life of the desert soon fatigues them, and they sigh for the
brilliant f&ecirc;tes of Peking.&nbsp; To obviate the
inconvenience that might attend their frequent journeys to the
capital, a very severe regulation has been made to moderate the
wandering humour of these princesses.&nbsp; First, for the first
ten years after their marriage, they are forbidden to come to
Peking, under penalty of having the annual pension the Emperor
allows to their husbands suspended.&nbsp; This period having
elapsed, they are allowed to go to Peking, but never at their own
mere fancy.&nbsp; <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>A tribunal is appointed to examine
their reasons for temporarily quitting their family.&nbsp; If
these are considered valid, they allow them a certain number of
days, on the expiration of which they are enjoined to return to
Tartary.&nbsp; During their stay at Peking, they are supported at
the expense of the Emperor, suitably to their dignity.</p>
<p>The most elevated personages in the hierarchy of the Mongol
princes, are the Thsin-Wang and the Kiun-Wang.&nbsp; Their title
is equivalent to that of king.&nbsp; After them come the Peile,
the Beisse, the Koung of the first and second class, and the
Dchassak.&nbsp; These may be compared to our ancient dukes,
barons, etc.&nbsp; We have already mentioned that the Mongol
princes are bound to pay certain rents to the Emperor; but the
amount of these is so small, that the Mantchou dynasty can only
levy it on account of the moral effect that may result.&nbsp; As
simple matter-of-fact, it would be nearer the truth to say that
the Mantchous are the tributaries of the Mongols; for, in return
for the few beasts they receive from them, they give them
annually large sums of money, silken stuffs, clothes, and various
articles of luxury and ornament, such as buttons, sables,
peacocks&rsquo; feathers, etc.&nbsp; Each Wang of the first
degree receives annually 2,500 ounces of silver (about
&pound;800), and forty pieces of silk stuff.&nbsp; All the other
princes are paid according to the rank they derive from the
Emperor.&nbsp; A Dchassak, for example, receives yearly one
hundred ounces of silver, and four pieces of silk.</p>
<p>There exist certain Lamaseries, termed Imperial, where each
Lama, on obtaining the degree of Kalon, is obliged to offer to
the Emperor an ingot of silver of the value of fifty ounces; his
name is then inscribed on the register of the imperial clergy at
Peking, and he is entitled to the pension given yearly to the
Lamas of the Emperor.&nbsp; It is obvious that all these
measures, so calculated to flatter the self-love and avarice of
the Tartars, do not a little contribute to maintain their
feelings of respect and submission towards a government which
takes such pains to court their friendship.</p>
<p>The Mongols, however, of the district of the Khalkhas do not
seem to be much affected by these demonstrations.&nbsp; They only
see in the Mantchous a rival race, in possession of a prey which
they themselves have never ceased to desire.&nbsp; We have
frequently heard the Mongol Khalkhas use the most unceremonious
and seditious language in speaking of the Mantchou Emperor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are subject,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;to the
Guison-Tamba alone, to the <i>Most Holy</i>, and not to the
black-man (layman), who sits on the throne of
Peking.&rdquo;&nbsp; These redoubtable children of Tchinggiskhan
still seem to be cherishing in their inmost heart schemes of
conquest and <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>invasion.&nbsp; They only await,
they say, the command of their Grand Lama to march direct upon
Peking, and to regain an empire which they believe to be theirs,
for the sole reason that it was formerly theirs.&nbsp; The Mongol
princes exact from their subjects or slaves certain tributes,
which consist in sheep, and here is the absurd and unjust
regulation, in accordance with which this tribute must be
paid:</p>
<p>The owner of five or more oxen must contribute one sheep: the
owner of twenty sheep must contribute one of them; if he owns
forty he gives two; but they need give no more, however numerous
their flocks.&nbsp; As may be seen, this tribute really weighs
upon the poor only; the wealthy may possess a great number of
cattle without being obliged to contribute more than two
sheep.</p>
<p>Besides these regular tributes, there are others which the
princes are accustomed to levy on their slaves, on some
extraordinary occasions; for instance, marriages, burials, and
distant voyages.&nbsp; On these occasions, each collection of ten
tents is obliged to furnish a horse and a camel.&nbsp; Every
Mongol who owns three cows must pay a pail of milk; if he
possesses five, a pot of koumis or wine, made of fermented
milk.&nbsp; The owner of a flock of 100 sheep, furnishes a felt
carpet or a tent covering; he who owns three camels must give a
bundle of long cords to fasten the baggage.&nbsp; However, in a
country where everything is subject to the arbitrary will of the
chief, these regulations, as may be supposed, are not strictly
observed.&nbsp; Sometimes the subjects are altogether exempted
from their operation, and sometimes also there is exacted from
them much more than the law decrees.</p>
<p>Robbery and murder are very severely punished among the
Mongols; but the injured individuals, or their parents, are
themselves obliged to prosecute the prisoner before the
tribunals: the worst outrage remains unpunished if no one appears
to prosecute.&nbsp; In the ideas of a semi-barbarous people, the
man who attempts to take the property or life of any one, is
deemed to have committed merely a private offence, reparation for
which ought to be demanded, not by the public, but by the injured
party or his family.&nbsp; Theses rude notions of justice are
common to China and to Thibet; and for that matter, we know that
Rome herself had no other until the establishment of
Christianity, which caused the right of the community to prevail
over the right of the individual.</p>
<p>Mongolia, generally speaking, wears a gloomy and savage
aspect; the eye is nowhere recreated by the charm and variety of
landscape scenery.&nbsp; The monotony of the steppes is only
interrupted by ravines, by vast rents of the earth, or by stony
and barren hills.&nbsp; Towards the north, in the district of
Khalkhas, nature is more <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>animated;
tall forests decorate the summits of the mountains, and numerous
rivers water the rich pastures of the plains; but in the long
winter season, the earth remains buried under a thick bed of
snow.&nbsp; Towards the Great Wall, Chinese industry glides like
a serpent into the desert.&nbsp; Towns arise on all sides.&nbsp;
The Land of Grass is crowned with harvests, and the Mongol
shepherds find themselves driven back northwards, little by
little, by the encroachments of agriculture.</p>
<p>Sandy plains occupy, perhaps, the greater part of Mongolia;
you do not see a single tree there; some short, brittle grass,
which seems to have much difficulty in issuing from this
unfruitful soil, creeping briars, a few scanty tufts of heath,
such is the sole vegetation and pasturage of Gobi.&nbsp; Water is
very rarely seen; at long intervals you meet with a few deep
wells, dug for the convenience of the caravans that are obliged
to cross this dismal tract.</p>
<p>In Mongolia there are only two seasons in the year, nine
months for winter, and three for summer.&nbsp; Sometimes the heat
is stifling, particularly on the sandy steppes, but it only lasts
a few days.&nbsp; The nights, however, are almost invariably
cold.&nbsp; In the Mongol countries, cultivated by the Chinese,
outside the Great Wall, all agricultural labour must be
comprehended within three months.&nbsp; As soon as the earth is
sufficiently thawed, they hastily set to work, or rather they do
nothing but touch the surface of the ground lightly with the
plough; they then immediately sow the seed; the corn grows with
astonishing rapidity.&nbsp; Whilst they are waiting for it to
come to maturity, the men are incessantly occupied in pulling up
the weeds that overrun the plain.&nbsp; Scarcely have they
gathered in the harvest when the winter comes with its terrible
cold; during this season they thresh the corn.&nbsp; As the cold
makes vast crevices in the earth, they throw water over the
surface of the threshing-floor, which freezes forthwith, and
creates for the labourers, a place always smooth and admirably
clean.</p>
<p>The excessive cold which prevails in Mongolia may be
attributed to three causes:&mdash;to the great elevation of the
country; to the nitrous substances with which it is strongly
impregnated, and to the almost entire absence of
cultivation.&nbsp; In the places which the Chinese have
cultivated the temperature has risen in a remarkable degree; the
heat goes on increasing, so to speak, from year to year, as
cultivation advances; so that particular grain crops, which at
first would not grow at all, because of the cold, now ripen with
wonderful success.</p>
<p>Mongolia, on account of its immense solitudes, has become the
haunt of a large number of wild animals.&nbsp; You see at every
step, hares, pheasants, eagles, yellow goats, grey squirrels,
foxes and <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>wolves.&nbsp; It is remarkable that
the wolves of Mongolia attack men rather than animals.&nbsp; They
may be seen, sometimes, passing at full gallop, through a flock
of sheep, in order to attack the shepherd.&nbsp; About the Great
Wall they frequently visit the Tartaro-Chinese villages, enter
the farms, and disdaining the domestic animals they find in the
yard, proceed to the inside of the house, and there select their
human victims, whom they almost invariably seize by the throat
and strangle.&nbsp; There is scarcely a village in Tartary,
where, every year, misfortunes of this kind do not occur.&nbsp;
It would seem as though the wolves of this country were resolved
to avenge on men, the sanguinary war which the Tartars make upon
their brethren.</p>
<p>The stag, the wild goat, the mule, the wild camel, the yak,
the brown and black bear, the lynx, the ounce and the tiger,
frequent the deserts of Mongolia.&nbsp; The Tartars never proceed
on a journey, unless armed with bows, fusils and lances.</p>
<p>When we consider the horrible climate of Tartary, that climate
ever so gloomy and frozen, we should be led to think that the
inhabitants of these wild countries must be of an extremely
fierce and rugged temperament; their physiognomy, their
deportment, the costume they wear, all would seem to confirm this
opinion.&nbsp; The Mongol has a flat face, with prominent cheek
bones, the chin short and retiring, the forehead sunken, the eyes
small and oblique, of a yellow tint, as though full of bile, the
hair black and rugged, the beard scanty, the skin of a deep
brown, and extremely coarse.&nbsp; The Mongol is of middle
height, but his great leathern boots and large sheep-skin robe,
seem to take away from his height, and make him appear diminutive
and stumpy.&nbsp; To complete this portrait, we must add a heavy
and ponderous gait, and a harsh, shrill, discordant language,
full of frightful aspirates.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this rough and
unprepossessing exterior, the disposition of the Mongol is full
of gentleness and good nature; he passes suddenly from the most
rollicking and extravagant gaiety to a state of melancholy, which
is by no means disagreeable.&nbsp; Timid to excess in his
ordinary habits; when fanaticism or the desire of vengeance
arouses him, he displays in his courage an impetuosity which
nothing can stay; he is candid and credulous as an infant, and he
passionately loves to hear marvellous anecdotes and
narratives.&nbsp; The meeting with a travelling Lama is always
for him a source of happiness.</p>
<p>Aversion to toil and a sedentary life, the love of pillage and
rapine, cruelty, unnatural debaucheries, are the vices which have
been generally attributed to the Mongol Tartars.&nbsp; We are apt
to believe that the portrait which the old writers have drawn of
them was not exaggerated, for we always find these terrible
hordes, at <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>the period of their gigantic
conquests, bringing in their train, murder, pillage,
conflagration, and every description of scourge.&nbsp; But are
the Mongols the same now that they were formerly?&nbsp; We
believe we can affirm the contrary, at least to a great
extent.&nbsp; Wherever we have seen them, we have found them to
be generous, frank, and hospitable; inclined, it is true, like
ill-educated children, to pilfer little things which excite their
curiosity, but by no means in the habit of practising what is
called pillage and robbery.&nbsp; As to their aversion for toil
and a sedentary life, they are just the same as heretofore.&nbsp;
It must also be admitted that their manners are very free, but
their conduct has more in it of recklessness than of absolute
corruption.&nbsp; We seldom find among them those unbridled and
brutal debaucheries to which the Chinese are so much given.</p>
<p>The Mongols are strangers to every kind of industry.&nbsp;
Some felt carpets, some rudely tanned hides, a little needlework
and embroidery, are exceptions not deserving of mention.&nbsp; On
the other hand, they possess to perfection the qualities of a
pastoral and nomad people.&nbsp; They have the senses of sight,
hearing, and scent prodigiously developed.&nbsp; The Mongol is
able to hear at a very long distance the trot of a horse, to
distinguish the form of objects, and to detect the distant scent
of flocks, and the smoke of an encampment.</p>
<p>Many attempts have already been made to propagate Christianity
among the Tartars, and we may say that they have not been
altogether fruitless.&nbsp; Towards the end of the eighth century
and in the commencement of the ninth, Timothy, patriarch of the
Nestorians, sent some monks to preach the Gospel to the
Hioung-Nou Tartars, who had taken refuge on the shores of the
Caspian Sea.&nbsp; At a later period they penetrated into Central
Asia, and into China.&nbsp; In the time of Tchinggiskhan and his
successors, Franciscan and Dominican missionaries were dispatched
to Tartary.&nbsp; The conversions were numerous; even princes, it
is said, and emperors were baptized.&nbsp; But we must not
entirely credit the statements of the Tartar ambassadors, who,
the more easily to draw the Christian princes of Europe into a
league against the Moslems, never failed to state that their
masters had been baptized, and had made profession of
Christianity.&nbsp; It is certain, however, that at the
commencement of the fourteenth century, Pope Clement V. erected
at Peking an archbishopric, in favour of Jean de Montcorvin, a
Franciscan missionary who preached the Gospel to the Tartars for
forty-two years; he translated into the Mongol language the New
Testament and the Psalms of David, and left at his death a very
flourishing Christendom.&nbsp; We find on this subject some
curious <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>details in &ldquo;Le Livre de
l&rsquo;Estat du Grant Caan&rdquo; <a name="citation259"></a><a
href="#footnote259" class="citation">[259]</a> (The book of the
State of the Grand Khan), extracted from a manuscript of the
National Library, and published in the &ldquo;Nouveau Journal
Asiatique&rdquo; (vol. vi.), by M. Jacquet, a learned
orientalist.&nbsp; We conceive that it may be acceptable to quote
a few passages from this production.</p>
<h3>OF THE MINORITES WHO DWELL IN THIS COUNTRY OF CATHAY
(CHINA).</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the said city of Cambalech was an archbishop, who
was called Brother John of Mount Curvin, of the order of
Minorites, and he was legate there for Pope Clement V.&nbsp; This
archbishop erected in that city aforesaid, three houses of
Minorites, and they are two leagues distant from one
another.&nbsp; He likewise instituted two others in the city of
Racon, which is a long distance from Cambalech, being a journey
of three months, and it is on the sea coast; and in these two
places were put two Minorites as bishops.&nbsp; The one was named
Brother Andrew of Paris, and the other, Brother Peter of
Florence.&nbsp; These brothers, and John the Archbishop,
converted many persons to the faith of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He is
a man of irreproachable life, agreeable to God and the world, and
very much in the Emperor&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; The Emperor
provided him and all his people with all things necessary, and he
was much beloved by both Christians and Pagans; and he certainly
would have converted all that country to the Christian and
Catholic faith, if the false and misbelieving Nestorian
Christians had not prevented it.&nbsp; The archbishop had great
trouble in restoring these Nestorians to the obedience of our
Holy Mother the Roman Church; without which obedience, he said,
they could not be saved; and on this account these Nestorian
schismatics disliked him greatly.&nbsp; This archbishop has just
departed, as it pleased God, from this life.&nbsp; A great
multitude of Christians and Pagans attended his funeral; and the
Pagans tore their funeral robes, as is their custom.&nbsp; And
these Christians and infidels took, with great reverence, the
robes of the archbishop, and held them in great respect, and as
relics.&nbsp; He was buried there honourably, in the fashion of
the faithful.&nbsp; They still visit his tomb with great
devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>OF CERTAIN NESTORIAN CHRISTIAN SCHISMATICS WHO DWELL
THERE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the said city of Cambalech there is a sort of
Christian schismatics whom they call Nestorians.&nbsp; They
observe the customs <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>and manners of the Greek Church, and
are not obedient to the Holy Church of Rome; but they are of
another sect, and are at great enmity with all the Catholic
Christians who are loyal to the Holy Church of Rome
aforesaid.&nbsp; And when the archbishop, of whom we spoke just
now, built those abbeys of Minorites aforesaid, the Nestorians
destroyed them in the night, and did them all the mischief in
their power; for they dared not injure the said archbishop, or
his brethren, or the other faithful Christians publicly and
openly, because the Emperor loved them and showed them his
favour.&nbsp; These Nestorians dwelling in the said empire of
Cathay, number more than 30,000, and are very rich; but many of
them fear the Christians.&nbsp; They have very beautiful and very
holy churches, with crosses and images in honour of God and of
the saints.&nbsp; They receive from the said Emperor several
offices, and he grants them many privileges, and it is thought
that if they would consent to unite and agree with these
Minorites and with other good Christians who reside in this
country, they might convert the whole of this country and the
Emperor to the true faith.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>OF THE EXTRAORDINARY FAVOUR WHICH THE GRAND KHAN SHOWS TO THE
SAID CHRISTIANS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Grand Khan protects the Christians who in this said
kingdom are obedient to the Holy Church of Rome, and makes
provision for all their wants, for he shows them very great
favour and love; and whenever they require anything for their
churches, their crosses, or their sanctuaries, in honour of Jesus
Christ, he awards it with great willingness.&nbsp; But they must
pray to God for him and his health particularly in their
sermons.&nbsp; And he is very anxious that they should all pray
for him; and he readily allows the brethren to preach the faith
of God in the churches of the infidels, which they call
<i>vritanes</i>, and he also permits the infidels to hear the
brethren preach; so that the infidels go there very willingly,
and often with great devotion, and give the brethren much alms;
and, likewise, the Emperor lends and sends his servants to aid
and assist the Christians when they require their services, and
so solicit the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Tartars remained masters of China, Christianity made
great progress in the empire.&nbsp; At the present day (we say it
with sorrow), there is not to be found in Mongolia the least
vestige of what was done in ages gone by, in favour of these
nomad people.&nbsp; We trust, however, that the light of the
Gospel will ere long shine once more in their eyes.&nbsp; The
zeal of Europeans for the <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>propagation
of the faith will hasten the accomplishment of Noah&rsquo;s
prophecy.&nbsp; Missionaries, the children of Japheth, will
display their courage and devotion: they will fly to the aid of
the children of Shem, and will esteem themselves happy to pass
their days under the Mongol tents:&nbsp; &ldquo;God shall enlarge
Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem.&rdquo;&mdash;Genes. cap. ix. v. 27.</p>

<p>Two months had elapsed since our departure from the Valley of
Black Waters.&nbsp; During that period, we had undergone in the
desert continual fatigue and privations of every kind.&nbsp; Our
health, it is true, was not as yet materially impaired, but we
felt that our strength was leaving us, and we appreciated the
necessity of modifying, for a few days, our late rough manner of
living.&nbsp; In this <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>point of view a country occupied by
Chinese could not be otherwise than agreeable, and, in comparison
with Tartary, would place within our reach all sorts of
comforts.</p>
<p>As soon as we had passed the Hoang-Ho, we entered the small
frontier town called Ch&eacute;-Tsui-Dze, which is only separated
from the river by a sandy beach.&nbsp; We proceeded to take up
our lodging at the Hotel of Justice and Mercy
(<i>Jeu-y-Ting</i>).&nbsp; The house was large and recently
built.&nbsp; With the exception of a solid floor of grey tiles,
the whole construction was of wood.&nbsp; The host received us
with that courtesy and attention which are always displayed when
people desire to give a character to a new establishment; and,
besides, the man having a most unprepossessing aspect, was
anxious, probably, by his amiability of manners, to redeem his
ugliness of feature; his eyes, which squinted horribly, were
always turned away from the person whom he was addressing.&nbsp;
However, if the organ of sight was defective, the organ of speech
bad marvellous elasticity.&nbsp; In his quality of an old
soldier, he had seen much, heard much, and what is more, he
remembered much; he was acquainted with all countries, and had
had to do with all sorts of men.&nbsp; His loquacity was far from
being troublesome to us: he gave us details of every kind, as to
the places, great and small, which we had to visit before our
arrival at Koukou-Noor.&nbsp; That part of Tartary was well known
to him; for, in the military part of his career, he had served
against the Si-Fan.&nbsp; The day after our arrival he brought
us, early in the morning, a large scroll, on which were written,
in order, the names of the towns, villages, hamlets, and places
that we had to pass in the province of Kan-Sou; and then he
proceeded to give us a description of the localities with so much
enthusiasm, so much gesticulation, and in such a loud key, that
he made our heads turn.</p>
<p>The time which was not absorbed in long interviews, partly
compulsory, partly voluntary, with our host, was occupied in
visiting the town.&nbsp; Ch&eacute;-Tsui-Dze is built in the
corner of an angle, formed on one side by the Alechan mountains,
and on the other by the Yellow River.&nbsp; On its eastern bank
the Hoang-Ho is bordered by dark hills, wherein are abundant coal
mines, which the inhabitants work with great activity, and whence
they derive their chief wealth.&nbsp; The suburbs of the town are
occupied by great potteries, where you observe colossal urns,
used in families as reservoirs of water, and large stoves of
admirable construction, and a large collection of vases of all
shapes and sizes.&nbsp; There is in the province of Kan-Sou a
large trade in this pottery.</p>
<p>At Ch&eacute;-Tsui-Dze, provisions are abundant, varied, and
of astonishingly moderate price.&nbsp; Nowhere, perhaps, can a
person <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>live so economically.&nbsp; At every
hour of the day and night, itinerant restaurateurs bring to your
house whatever provisions you need: soups, ragouts of mutton and
beef, vegetables, pastry, rice, vermicelli, etc.&nbsp; There are
dinners for every appetite, and for every purse&mdash;from the
complicated banquet of the rich, to the simple and clear broth of
the beggar.&nbsp; These restaurateurs are coming and going to and
fro almost without interval.&nbsp; They are generally
Moslems&mdash;a blue cap distinguishing them from the
Chinese.</p>
<p>After two days repose in the Inn of Justice and Mercy, we
proceeded on our way.&nbsp; The environs of Ch&eacute;-Tsui-Dze
are uncultivated.&nbsp; On all sides, nothing is to be seen but
sand and gravel, drifted by the annual inundation of the Yellow
River.&nbsp; However, as you advance, the soil, becoming
imperceptibly higher, improves.&nbsp; An hour&rsquo;s distance
from the town, we crossed the Great Wall, or rather passed over
some miserable ruins that still mark the ancient site of the
celebrated rampart of China.&nbsp; The country soon becomes
magnificent, and we could not but admire the agricultural genius
of the Chinese people.&nbsp; The part of Kan-Sou which we were
traversing, is especially remarkable by its ingenious and
extensive works for facilitating the irrigation of the
fields.</p>
<p>By means of creeks cut in the banks of the Yellow River, the
waters are conveyed into broad artificial canals; these again
supply others of a larger size, which, in their turn, fill the
ditches with which all the fields are surrounded.&nbsp; Sluices,
great and small, admirable in their simplicity, serve to raise
the water and to carry it over all the inequalities of the
land.&nbsp; The distribution of the water is perfectly arranged;
each landowner waters his fields in his turn, and no one is
allowed to open his flood-gate before his regularly appointed
time.</p>
<p>Few villages are met with; but you observe, in all directions,
farms of various sizes separated from one another by
meadows.&nbsp; The eye does not rest upon either groves or
pleasure-gardens.&nbsp; Except a few large trees round the
dwellings, all the land is devoted to the cultivation of corn;
they do not even reserve a space for stacking the harvest, but
pile it up on the tops of the houses, which are always
flat-roofed.&nbsp; On the days of the general irrigation, the
country gives you a perfect idea of those famous inundations of
the Nile, the descriptions of which have become so classic.&nbsp;
The inhabitants traverse their fields in small skiffs, or in
light carts with enormous wheels, and generally drawn by
buffaloes.</p>
<p>These irrigations, so conducive to the fertility of the land,
are a great pest to travellers.&nbsp; The roads are generally
covered with water and mud, so that you cannot use them, but must
labour along the mounds which form the boundaries of the
fields.&nbsp; When you <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>have to
guide camels over such roads, it is the height of misery.&nbsp;
We did not advance a single step without the fear of seeing our
baggage fall into the mud; and more than once such an accident
did occur, throwing us into infinite embarrassment.&nbsp; In
fact, that the misfortune did not oftener befall us, was solely
attributable to the skill in mud-walking which our camels had
acquired in their apprenticeship amongst the marshes of the
Ortous.</p>
<p>In the evening of our first day&rsquo;s march, we arrived at a
small village called Wang-Ho-Po; we had expected to find here the
same facility in obtaining provisions as at Ch&eacute;-Tsui-Dze,
but we were soon undeceived.&nbsp; The customs were not the same;
those amiable restaurateurs, with their baskets of ready-dressed
viands, were no longer visible.&nbsp; Forage-dealers were the
only persons who came to offer their goods.&nbsp; We therefore
commenced by giving the animals their rations, and afterwards
went into the village to see if we could find any provisions for
our own supper.&nbsp; On our return to the inn, we were obliged
to cook our own supper; the host merely furnished us with water,
coal, and a meal-kettle.&nbsp; Whilst we were peaceably occupied
in appreciating the result of our culinary labours, a great
tumult arose in the courtyard of the inn.&nbsp; It was occasioned
by a caravan of camels, conducted by Chinese merchants, who were
going to the town of Ning-Hia.&nbsp; Destined for the same route
as themselves, we soon entered into conversation.&nbsp; They told
us that the direct road to Ning-Hia was so bad as to be
impracticable, even for the best camels; but they added, they
were acquainted with a cross-road shorter and less dangerous, and
they invited us to go with them.&nbsp; As they were to depart in
the night, we called the host in order to settle our
account.&nbsp; After the Chinese fashion, when sapeks are in
question, on one side they ask much, on the other they offer too
little; then there is a long squabble, and after mutual
concessions you come to an agreement.&nbsp; As they thought us
Tartars, it was quite a matter of course with them to ask us
nearly triple the just amount: the result was, that the dispute
was twice as long as it ordinarily is.&nbsp; We had to discuss
the matter vigorously; first, for ourselves, then for our beasts,
for the room, the stabling, the watering, the kettle, the coal,
the lamp, for every single item, until at length we got the
innkeeper down to the tariff of civilised people.&nbsp; The
unfortunate Tartar exterior, which, for other reasons, we had
assumed, had been the occasion of our acquiring a certain degree
of dexterity in discussions of this kind; for not a day passed,
during our journey through the province of Kan-Sou, in which we
had not to quarrel, in this manner, with innkeepers.&nbsp; Such
quarrels, however, involve no disagreeable results; you dispute,
and dispute, and <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>then you come to an agreement, and
the matter is over, and you are as good friends as ever with your
antagonist.</p>
<p>It was scarcely past midnight when the Chinese camel-drivers
were on foot, making, with great tumult, their preparations for
departure.&nbsp; We rose, but it was to no purpose that we
expedited the saddling of our animals; our fellow travellers were
ready before us and went on, promising to proceed slowly till we
came up with them.&nbsp; The instant that our camels were ready,
we departed.&nbsp; The night was dark; it was impossible to
discover our guides.&nbsp; With the aid of a small lamp we sought
traces of them, but we were not successful.&nbsp; Our only
course, therefore, was to proceed, at chance, across these marshy
plains, which were altogether unknown to us.&nbsp; We soon found
ourselves so involved in the inundated soil, that we dared
advance no farther, and halted at a bank, and there awaited
daybreak.</p>
<p>As soon as the day dawned, we directed our steps, by a
thousand ins and outs, towards a large walled town that we
perceived in the distance; it was Ping-Lou-Hien, a town of the
third class.&nbsp; Our arrival in this town occasioned lamentable
disorder.&nbsp; The country is remarkable for the number and
beauty of its mules; and at this juncture there was one of these
standing, fastened by a halter, before each of the houses of the
long street, which we were traversing from north to south.&nbsp;
As we proceeded, all these animals, seized with fright at the
sight of our camels, reared on their hind legs and dashed with
violence against the shops; some broke the halters which confined
them, tore off at a gallop, and overthrew, in their flight, the
stalls of the street merchants.&nbsp; The people gathered
together, sent forth shouts, anathematised the stinking Tartars,
cursed the camels, and increased the disorder instead of
lessening it.&nbsp; We were grieved to find that our presence had
such unfortunate results; but what could we do?&nbsp; We could
not render the mules less timid, nor prevent the camels from
having a frightful appearance.&nbsp; One of us, at last,
determined to run on before the caravan, and inform the people of
the approach of the camels.&nbsp; This precaution diminished the
evil, which did not, however, entirely cease until we were
outside the gates of the town.</p>
<p>We had intended to breakfast at Ping-Lou-Hien; but, not having
conciliated the good-will of its inhabitants, we dared not stop
there.&nbsp; We had only the courage to purchase some provisions,
for which we paid an exorbitant price, the occasion not being
favourable for bargaining.&nbsp; At some distance from the town,
we came to a guard-house, where we stopped to rest awhile, and to
take our morning repast.&nbsp; These guard-houses are very
numerous in China, the rule being that there shall be one of them
at every <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>half-league, on all the great
roads.&nbsp; Of a singular and entirely Chinese construction,
these barracks consist of a little edifice, either of wood or
earth, but always whitewashed.&nbsp; In the centre, is a kind of
shed, entirely without furniture, and with one large opening in
front.&nbsp; This is reserved for unfortunate travellers, who,
during the night, being overtaken by bad weather, cannot take
refuge in an inn.&nbsp; On each side is a little room with doors
and windows, and sometimes with a wooden bench painted red, by
way of furniture.&nbsp; The exterior of the barrack is decorated
with rude pictures, representing the gods of war, cavalry, and
fabulous animals; on the walls of the shed are drawn all the
weapons used in China, matchlocks, bows, and arrows, lances,
bucklers, and sabres of every description.&nbsp; At a little
distance from the barrack, you see on the right a square tower,
and on the left, five small posts standing in a line.&nbsp; These
denote the five lis which are the distance from one guard-house
to another; frequently a large board, on two poles, informs the
traveller of the names of the nearest towns, in that
quarter.&nbsp; The directions on the board now before us were
these:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>From Ping-Lou-Hien to Ning-Hia, fifty lis.</p>
<p>Northwards to Ping-Lou-Hien, five lis.</p>
<p>Southwards to Ning-Hia, forty-five lis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In time of war, the square tower serves during the night for
giving signals by means of fireworks, combined in particular
ways.&nbsp; The Chinese relate that the Emperor Yeou-Wang, the
thirteenth emperor of the Tcheou dynasty, 780 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, yielding to the absurd solicitations
of his wife, ordered one night the signals of alarm to be
made.&nbsp; The Empress wanted at once to amuse herself at the
expense of the soldiers, and to ascertain, at the same time,
whether these fireworks would really bring the troops to succour
the capital.&nbsp; As the signals passed on to the provinces, the
governors dispatched the military Mandarins and their forces to
Peking.&nbsp; When the soldiers learned, on their arrival, that
they had been called together for the capricious amusement of a
woman, they returned home full of indignation.&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards, the Tartars made an irruption into the empire, and
advanced with rapidity to the very walls of the capital.&nbsp;
This time the Emperor gave the alarm in grave earnest, but
throughout the provinces not a man stirred, thinking the Empress
was again amusing herself; the consequence was, that the Tartars
entered Peking, and the imperial family was massacred.</p>
<p>The profound peace which China has enjoyed so long has much
diminished the importance of these guard-houses.&nbsp; When they
decay they are seldom repaired; in most cases their doors and
windows have been carried off, and no one lives in them at
all.&nbsp; <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>On some of the more frequented
roads, they keep in repair the direction-boards and the
posts.</p>
<p>The barrack where we halted was deserted.&nbsp; After having
tied our beasts to a thick post, we entered a room, and took in
peace a wholesome refreshment.&nbsp; Travellers looked at us as
they passed, and seemed a little surprised to find the place
turned into a dining-room.&nbsp; The finer people, especially,
smiled at these three uncivilised Mongols, as they deemed
us.&nbsp; Our halt was brief.&nbsp; The direction-board
officially announced that we had yet forty-five lis&rsquo; march
before we reached Ning-Hia, so that, considering the difficulty
of the road, and the slowness of our camels, we had no time to
lose.&nbsp; We proceeded along the banks of a magnificent canal,
supplied by the waters of the Yellow River, and destined for the
irrigation of the fields.&nbsp; Whilst the small caravan was
slowly marching over a muddy and slippery ground, we saw
advancing towards us a numerous party of horsemen.&nbsp; As the
retinue came up, the innumerable labourers who were repairing the
banks of the canal, prostrated themselves on the earth, and
exclaimed, &ldquo;Peace and happiness to our father and
mother!&rdquo;&nbsp; We at once understood that the person so
addressed was a superior Mandarin.&nbsp; In accordance with the
strict rules of Chinese etiquette, we ought to have dismounted,
and have prostrated ourselves, as the others did; but we
considered that, in our quality of priests of the Western Heaven,
we might dispense with this troublesome and disagreeable
ceremony.&nbsp; We remained, therefore, gravely seated on our
steeds, and advanced quietly.&nbsp; At sight of our camels, the
other horsemen prudently removed to a respectful distance; but
the Mandarin, to show his bravery, spurred his horse, and
compelled it to come towards us.&nbsp; He saluted us politely,
and made inquiries in Mongol as to our health and our
journey.&nbsp; As his horse grew more and more afraid of our
camels, he was constrained to cut short the conversation, and to
rejoin his retinue, but he went away, triumphant at the
reflection that he had found an opportunity of speaking Mongol,
and of thus giving the horsemen of his suite a high notion of his
knowledge.&nbsp; This Mandarin appeared to us to be a
Tartar-Mantchou; he was making an official inspection of the
irrigating canals.</p>
<p>We proceeded still some way along the banks of the same canal,
meeting nothing on our road but some carriages on large wheels,
drawn by buffaloes, and a few travellers mounted on asses of
lofty stature.&nbsp; At length, we discerned the lofty ramparts
of Ning-Hia, and the numerous kiosks of the pagodas, which looked
in the distance like tall cedars.&nbsp; The brick-walls of
Ning-Hia are ancient, but well preserved.&nbsp; The antiquity,
which has almost entirely covered them with moss and lichen,
gives them a grand and imposing aspect.&nbsp; <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>On every
side they are surrounded by marshes, where canes, reeds, and
water-lilies grow in abundance.&nbsp; The interior of the town is
poor and miserable; the streets are dirty, narrow, and tortuous;
the houses smoke-dried and tottering; you see at once that
Ning-Hia is a town of very great antiquity.&nbsp; Although
situated near the frontiers of Tartary, the commerce there is
inconsiderable.</p>
<p>After having gone nearly half up the central street, as we
found we had still a league to go before we reached the other
extremity, we resolved to make a halt.&nbsp; We entered a large
inn, where we were soon followed by three individuals who
impudently demanded our passports.&nbsp; We saw at once that we
had to defend our purses against three swindlers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who are you that dare to demand our
passports?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are employed by the great
tribunal: it is not lawful for strangers to pass through the town
of Ning-Hia without a passport.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead of replying
we called the innkeeper and desired him to write upon a small
piece of paper, his name and that of his inn.&nbsp; Our demand
greatly surprised him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the good of this
writing? what are you going to do with it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
shall soon have need of it.&nbsp; We are going to the great
tribunal, to inform the Mandarin that three thieves have sought
to rob us in your inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these words the three
collectors of passports took to their heels; the landlord loaded
them with imprecations, and the mob, who were already assembled
in great numbers, laughed heartily.&nbsp; This little adventure
caused us to be treated with especial respect.&nbsp; Next
morning, ere day had dawned, we were awakened by a terrible
noise, which arose all at once in the court-yard of the
inn.&nbsp; Amid the confusion of numerous voices that seemed in
violent dispute, we distinguished the words, &ldquo;Stinking
Tartar&mdash;camel&mdash;tribunal.&rdquo;&nbsp; We hastily
dressed ourselves, and proceeded to investigate the nature of
this sudden uproar, with which it struck us we had something to
do, and so it turned out; our camels had devoured, in the course
of the night, two cart-loads of osiers which were in the
yard.&nbsp; The remnants still lay scattered about.&nbsp; The
owners, strangers at the inn like ourselves, required to be paid
the price of their goods, and their demand we considered
perfectly just, only, we thought that the landlord alone was
bound to repair the damage.&nbsp; Before going to rest, we had
warned him of the danger in which the osiers lay.&nbsp; We had
told him that he had better place them elsewhere, for that the
camels would certainly break their halters in order to get at
them.&nbsp; The owners of the carts had joined with us in
advising their removal, but the landlord had laughed at our
fears, and asserted that camels did not like osiers.&nbsp; When
we had sufficiently explained the matter, the mob, the standing
jury among the Chinese, decided that the whole loss should be
made good by the <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>landlord; however, we had the
generosity not to demand the price of the halters of our
camels.</p>
<p>Immediately after this impartial judgment had been pronounced,
we departed on our way.&nbsp; The southern part of the town
seemed to us in even a worse condition than that which we had
passed through on the preceding evening.&nbsp; Several portions
were altogether pulled down and deserted: the only living things
to be seen were a few swine, raking up the rubbish.&nbsp; The
inhabitants of this large city were in a state of utter
misery.&nbsp; The greater number of them were covered with dirty
rags.&nbsp; Their pale visages, haggard and thin, showed that
they were often without the necessaries of life.&nbsp; Yet
Ning-Hia was once a royal town, and, doubtless, opulent and
flourishing.</p>
<p>In the tenth century, a prince of Tartar race, a native of
Tou-Pa, at present under the dominion of the Si-Fan, having
induced a few hordes to follow him, came, and formed, despite the
Chinese, a small state not far from the banks of the Yellow
River.&nbsp; He chose for his capital, Hia-Tcheou, which
afterwards came to be called Ning-Hia.&nbsp; It was from this
town, that this new kingdom was called Hia.&nbsp; It was in a
very flourishing state for more than two centuries; but in 1227,
it was involved in the common ruin, by the victories of
Tchinggiskhan, the founder of the Mongol dynasty.&nbsp; At
present Ning-Hia is one of the towns of the first class in the
province of Kan-Sou.</p>
<p>On quitting Ning-Hia, you enter upon a magnificent road,
almost throughout bordered by willows and jujube trees.&nbsp; At
intervals, you find small inns, where the traveller can rest and
refresh himself at small expense.&nbsp; He can buy there tea,
hard eggs, beans fried in oil, cakes, and fruit preserved in
sugar or salt.</p>
<p>This day&rsquo;s journey was one of absolute recreation.&nbsp;
Our camels, which had never travelled except in the deserts of
Tartary, seemed thoroughly sensible to the charms of
civilization; they turned their heads majestically right and
left, observing, with manifest interest, all that presented
itself on the way, men and things.&nbsp; They were not, however,
so wholly absorbed in the investigations of the industry and
manners of China as to withdraw their attention altogether from
its natural productions.&nbsp; The willows, especially, attracted
their interest; and when at all within their reach, they did not
fail to pluck the tender branches, which they masticated with
entire satisfaction.&nbsp; Sometimes, also, expanding their long
necks, they would smell the various delicacies displayed over the
inn doors, a circumstance which, of course, elicited vehement
protests from the innkeepers and other persons concerned.&nbsp;
The Chinese were not less struck with our camels, than our camels
were <!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>with China.&nbsp; The people
collected from all directions to see the caravan pass, and ranged
themselves on each side of the road; taking care, however, not to
approach too near the animals which excited their surprise, and
whose strength they instinctively dreaded.</p>
<p>Towards the close of this day&rsquo;s march we arrived at
Hia-Ho-Po, a large village without ramparts.&nbsp; We proceeded
to dismount at the Hotel of the Five Felicities
(<i>Ou-Fou-Tien</i>).&nbsp; We were occupied in giving forage to
our beasts, when a horseman bearing a white button on his cap,
appeared in the court of the inn.&nbsp; Without dismounting, or
making the accustomed salutation, he proceeded to bawl for the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;The great Mandarin is on his way
here,&rdquo; cried he, in curt and haughty tones; &ldquo;let
everything be clean and well swept.&nbsp; Let these Tartars go
and lodge elsewhere; the great Mandarin will not have camels in
the inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Coming from the courier of a Mandarin,
these insolent words did not surprise but they irritated
us.&nbsp; We pretended not to hear them, and quietly pursued our
occupation.&nbsp; The innkeeper, seeing that we paid no attention
to the order that had been made, advanced towards us, and laid
before us, with politeness mingled with embarrassment, the state
of the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; we said to him firmly;
&ldquo;go tell this white button that you have received us into
your inn, that we will remain there, and that Mandarins have no
right to come and take the places of travellers, who are already
lawfully established anywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; The innkeeper was
spared the trouble of reporting our words to white button, for
they had been pronounced in such a manner that he could hear them
himself.&nbsp; He dismounted forthwith; and addressing us
directly, said, &ldquo;The grand Mandarin will soon arrive; he
has a large retinue, and the inn is small; besides, how would the
horses venture to remain in this yard in presence of your
camels?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A man in the suite of a Mandarin,
and, moreover, adorned like you with a white button, should know
how to express himself&mdash;first, politely, and next,
justly.&nbsp; We have a right to remain here, and no one shall
expel us; and our camels shall remain tied to the door of our
room.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The grand Mandarin has ordered me to
come and prepare apartments for him, at the Hotel of the Five
Felicities.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well; prepare them, but
don&rsquo;t meddle with our things.&nbsp; If you cannot
accommodate yourselves here, reason suggests that you go and seek
a lodging elsewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And the great
Mandarin?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell your Mandarin that there are
three Lamas of the Western Heaven in this place, who are ready to
return to Ning-Hia to discuss the matter with him: or before the
tribunal, if it be necessary, at Peking; they know their way
thither.&rdquo;&nbsp; White button mounted and disappeared.&nbsp;
<!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>The host came to us immediately, and begged us to be
resolute.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you remain here,&rdquo; said he to us,
&ldquo;I am sure to profit a little by you; but if the Mandarin
takes your place, his people will turn my inn upside down, will
make us work all night, and then go away in the morning without
paying a farthing.&nbsp; And besides that, if I were forced to
send you away would not the Hotel of the Five Felicities lose its
reputation?&nbsp; Who would afterwards enter an inn where they
receive travellers only for the purpose of turning them out
again?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whilst the host was exhorting us to courage,
the courier of the Mandarin reappeared; he dismounted and made us
a profound bow, which we returned with the best grace
possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirs Lamas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have
ridden through Hia-Ho-Po; there is no other convenient inn.&nbsp;
Who says you are bound to cede to us your place?&nbsp; To speak
so were to talk inconsistently with reason!&nbsp; Now, observe,
Sirs Lamas; we are all travellers: we are all men far distant
from our families; cannot we consult together in a friendly
manner and arrange the matter like brothers?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;men ought always to deal
together like brothers; that is the true principle.&nbsp; When we
travel, we should live like travellers.&nbsp; When each gives way
a little, all are, in the end, accommodated.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Excellent saying! excellent saying!&rdquo; cried the
courier; and thereupon the most profound bows recommenced on both
sides.</p>
<p>After this brief introduction, which had perfectly reconciled
both parties, we deliberated amicably how we should best arrange
our common residence in the Hotel of the Five Felicities.&nbsp;
It was agreed that we should keep the room in which we were
already installed, and that we should tie up our camels in a
corner of the court, so that they might not terrify the horses of
the Mandarin.&nbsp; The courier was to dispose of the rest of the
place as he pleased.&nbsp; We hastened to remove our camels from
the door of our room and to place them as had been settled.&nbsp;
Just after sun-set we heard the Mandarin&rsquo;s party
approaching.&nbsp; The two folding doors of the great gate were
solemnly opened, and a carriage drawn by three mules advanced
into the middle of the court of the inn, escorted by a numerous
body of horsemen.&nbsp; In the carriage was seated a man about
sixty years old, with grey mustachios and beard, and having his
head covered with a red hood.&nbsp; This was the great
Mandarin.&nbsp; On entering, he scanned, with a quick and
searching glance, the interior of the inn.&nbsp; Perceiving us,
and remarking, above all, three camels at the end of the court,
the muscles of his lean face were suddenly contracted.&nbsp; When
all the horsemen had dismounted they invited him to descend from
his vehicle.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried he in a dry, angry
voice; &ldquo;who are those Tartars? what are those camels? <!--
page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>let the landlord be brought to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this
unexpected summons the host took to his heels, and white button
remained for an instant like one petrified: his face turned pale,
then red, then olive-colour.&nbsp; However, he made an effort,
advanced to the carriage, put one knee to the ground, then rose,
and approaching the ear of his master, spoke to him for some
time, in an undertone.&nbsp; The dialogue ended, the great
Mandarin condescended to dismount, and after having saluted us
with his hand in a protecting manner, he retired like a simple
mortal to the small room which had been prepared for him.</p>
<p>The triumph we had thus obtained in a country, admission even
to which was prohibited to us under pain of death, <a
name="citation273"></a><a href="#footnote273"
class="citation">[273]</a> gave us prodigious courage.&nbsp;
These terrible Mandarins, who had formerly occasioned us such
alarm, ceased to be terrible to us the instant that we dared to
approach them, and to look at them closely.&nbsp; We saw men
puffed up with pride and insolence, pitiless tyrants towards the
weak, but dastardly in the extreme before men of energy.&nbsp;
From this moment we found ourselves as much at our ease in China
as anywhere else, and able to travel without fear, and with our
heads erect in the open face of day.</p>
<p>After two days journey, we arrived at Tchong-Wei, on the banks
of the Yellow River, a walled town of moderate size.&nbsp; Its
cleanliness, its good condition, its air of comfort, contrasted
singularly with the wretchedness and ugliness of Ning-Hia; and
judging merely from its innumerable shops, all well stocked, and
from the large population crowding its streets, we should
pronounce Tchong-Wei to be a place of much commercial importance;
yet the Chinese of this district have no notion of navigation,
and not a boat is to be seen on the Yellow River in this
quarter&mdash;a circumstance remarkable in itself, and
confirmatory of the opinion that the inhabitants of this part of
Kan-Sou are of Thibetian and Tartar origin; for it is well known
that the Chinese are everywhere passionately addicted to
navigating streams and rivers.</p>
<p>On quitting Tchong-Wei we passed the Great Wall, which is
wholly composed of uncemented stones, placed one on top of the
other; and we re-entered Tartary, for a few days, in the kingdom
of the Alechan.&nbsp; More than once the Mongol Lamas had
depicted in frightful colours the horrors of the Alechan
mountains.&nbsp; We were now in a position to see with our own
eyes that the reality exceeds all description of this frightful
district.&nbsp; The Alechans are a long chain of mountains,
wholly composed of moving sand, so fine, that when you touch it,
it seems to flow through your finger like a liquid.&nbsp; <!--
page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>It were superfluous to add that, amid these gigantic
accumulations of sand, you do not find anywhere the least trace
of vegetation.&nbsp; The monotonous aspect of these immense sands
is only relieved by the vestiges of a small insect, that, in its
capricious and fantastical sports, describes a thousand
arabesques on the moving mass, which is so smooth and fine, that
you can trace upon it the meanderings of an ant.&nbsp; In
crossing these mountains, we experienced inexpressible labour and
difficulty.&nbsp; At each step our camels sank up to the knees;
and it was only by leaps that they could advance.&nbsp; The
horses underwent still greater difficulties, their hoofs having
less purchase on the sand than the large feet of the
camels.&nbsp; As for ourselves, forced to walk, we had to keep
constant watch that we did not fall from the top of these
mountains, which seemed to disappear under our feet, into the
Yellow River, whose waters flowed beneath us.&nbsp; Fortunately,
the weather was calm.&nbsp; If the wind had blown, we should
certainly have been swallowed up and buried alive in avalanches
of sand.&nbsp; The Alechan mountains themselves appear to have
been formed by the sand which the north wind incessantly sweeps
before it from the Chamo, or Great Desert of Gobi.&nbsp; The
Yellow River arrests these sandy inundations, and thus preserves
the province of Kan-Sou from their destructive assaults.&nbsp; It
is to the great quantity of sand that falls into it from the
Alechan mountains that this river owes the yellow colour which
has given to it its name <i>Hoang-Ho</i> (Yellow River).&nbsp;
Above the Alechan mountains its waters are clear and limpid.</p>
<p>By degrees, hills succeeded to mountains, the sand heaps
imperceptibly diminished, and towards the close of the day we
arrived at the village of Ever-Flowing Waters
(<i>Tchang-Lieou-Chouy</i>).&nbsp; Here we found, amidst those
sand hills, an oasis of surpassing beauty.&nbsp; A hundred rills
disporting through the streets, trees, little houses built of
stone, and painted white or red, communicated to the spot an
aspect highly picturesque.&nbsp; Weary as we were, we halted at
Ever-Flowing Waters with inexpressible delight; but the poetry of
the thing vanished when we came to settle with our host.&nbsp;
Not only provisions but forage came from Tchong-Wei, and the
transport being very difficult, they were dear to a degree that
altogether disconcerted our economical arrangements.&nbsp; For
ourselves and our animals, we were obliged to disburse 1,600
sapeks, a matter of nearly seven shillings.&nbsp; Only for this
circumstance we should perhaps have quitted with regret the
charming village of Tchang-Lieou-Chouy; but there is always
something which intervenes to aid man in detaching himself from
the things of this world.</p>
<p>On quitting Tchang-Lieou-Chouy, we took the road followed by
the Chinese exiles on their way to Ili.&nbsp; The country is
somewhat <!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>less dreadful than that which we had
travelled through on the preceding day, but it is still very
dismal.&nbsp; Gravel had taken the place of sand, and with the
exception that it produced a few tufts of grass, hard and
prickly, the soil was arid and barren.&nbsp; We reached, in due
course, Kao-Tan-Dze, a village repulsive and hideous beyond all
expression.&nbsp; It consists of a few miserable habitations,
rudely constructed of black earth, and all of them inns.&nbsp;
Provisions are even more scarce there than at Ever-Flowing
Waters, and correspondingly dearer.&nbsp; Every thing has to be
brought from Tchong-Wei, for the district produces nothing, not
even water.&nbsp; Wells have been sunk to a very great depth, but
nothing has been found except hard, rocky, moistureless
earth.&nbsp; The inhabitants of Kao-Tan-Dze have to fetch their
water a distance of more than twelve miles, and they accordingly
charge travellers a monstrous price for every drop.&nbsp; A
single bucket costs sixty sapeks.&nbsp; Had we attempted to water
our camels, we should have had to lay out fifty fifties of
sapeks; we were therefore forced to be content with drinking
ourselves, and giving a draught to our horses.&nbsp; As to the
camels, they had to await better days and a less inhospitable
soil.</p>
<p>Kao-Tan-Dze, miserable and hideous as it is, has not even the
advantage of that tranquillity and security which its poverty and
its solitude might reasonably be supposed to give it.&nbsp; It is
constantly ravaged by brigands, so that there is not a house in
it which does not bear the marks of fire and devastation.&nbsp;
At the first inn where we presented ourselves, we were asked
whether we desired to have our animals defended against
robbers.&nbsp; This question threw us into utter amazement, and
we requested further explanation of a point which struck us as so
very singular.&nbsp; We were informed that at Kao-Tan-Dze there
are two sorts of inns: inns where they fight, and inns where they
do not fight; and that the prices at the former sort are four
times greater than those at the latter.&nbsp; This explanation
gave us a general notion of the matter; but still we requested
some details.&nbsp; &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said the people.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that Kao-Tan-Dze is constantly
attacked by brigands?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we know
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you lodge in an inn where they
don&rsquo;t fight, any brigands that come will drive off your
animals; for no one has undertaken to protect them.&nbsp; If, on
the contrary, you lodge in an inn where they fight, you have a
good chance of preserving your property, unless the brigands are
the more numerous party, which sometimes happens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
All this seemed to us very singular, and very disagreeable.&nbsp;
However, it was necessary to make up our minds on the
subject.&nbsp; After grave reflection, we decided upon lodging in
an inn where they fought.&nbsp; It occurred to us that the worthy
innkeepers of Kao-Tan-Dze had an understanding with <!-- page
276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>the brigands, having for its result the spoliation of
travellers, one way or the other, and that therefore it was
better, upon the whole, to pay the larger sum, by way of
black-mail, than to lose our animals, whose loss would involve
our own destruction.</p>
<p>Upon entering the fighting inn, to which we had been directed,
we found every thing about it on a war footing.&nbsp; The walls
were regularly covered with lances, arrows, bows, and
matchlocks.&nbsp; The presence of those weapons, however, by no
means rendered us perfectly satisfied as to our safety, and we
resolved not to lie down at all, but to keep watch throughout the
night.</p>
<p>Kao-Tan-Dze, with its robber assailants and its pauper
population, was to us an inexplicable place.&nbsp; We could not
conceive how men should make up their minds to inhabit a
detestably ugly country like this, sterile, waterless, remote
from any other inhabited place, and desolated by the constant
inroad of brigands.&nbsp; What could be their object?&nbsp; What
possible advantage could be their inducement?&nbsp; We turned the
matter over in all ways; we framed all sorts of suppositions; but
we could achieve no likely solution of the problem.&nbsp; During
the first watch of the night, we conversed with the innkeeper,
who seemed a frank, open sort of man enough.&nbsp; He related to
us infinite anecdotes of brigands, full of battle, murder, and
fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
you leave this detestable country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
replied he, &ldquo;we are not free men; the inhabitants of
Kao-Tan-Dze are all exiles, who are only excused from going to
Ili on the condition that we remain here for the purpose of
supplying with water the Mandarins and soldiers who pass through
the place, escorting exiles.&nbsp; We are bound to furnish water
gratuitously to all the government officers who come to the
village.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we found that we were among exiles, we
were somewhat reassured, and began to think that, after all,
these people were not in collusion with the brigands; for we
learned that a petty Mandarin lived in the village to superintend
the population.&nbsp; We conceived a hope that we might find some
Christians at Kao-Tan-Dze, but the innkeeper informed us that
there were none, for that all exiles on account of the religion
of the Lord of Heaven, went on to Ili.</p>
<p>After what the innkeeper had told us, we conceived that we
might, without risk, take a brief repose; we accordingly threw
ourselves on our goatskins, and slept soundly till daybreak, the
favour of God preserving us from any visit on the part of the
brigands.</p>
<p>During the greater part of the day, we proceeded along the
road to Ili, traversing with respect, with a degree of religious
veneration, that path of exile so often sanctified by the
footsteps of the confessors of the faith, and conversing, as we
went, about those <!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>courageous Christians, those strong
souls, who, rather than renounce their religion, had abandoned
their families and their country, and gone to end their days in
unknown lands.&nbsp; Let us fervently pray that Providence may
send missionaries, full of devotion, to bear the consolations of
the faith amongst these our exiled brethren.</p>
<p>The road to Ili brought us to the Great Wall, which we passed
over without dismounting.&nbsp; This work of the Chinese nation,
of which so much is said and so little known, merits brief
mention here.&nbsp; It is known that the idea of raising walls as
a fortification against the incursions of enemies, was not
peculiar, in old times, to China: antiquity presents us with
several examples of these labours elsewhere.&nbsp; Besides the
works of this kind executed in Syria, Egypt, Media, and on the
continent of Europe, there was, by order of the Emperor Septimus
Severus, a great wall constructed in the northern part of
Britain.&nbsp; No other nation, however, ever effected anything
of the sort on so grand a scale as the Great Wall, commenced by
Tsin-Chi-Hoang-Ti, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 214.&nbsp; The
Chinese call it <i>Wan-li-Tchang-Tching</i> (the Great Wall of
ten thousand lis.)&nbsp; A prodigious number of labourers was
employed upon it, and the works of this gigantic enterprise
continued for ten years.&nbsp; The Great Wall extends from the
westernmost point of Kan-Sou to the Eastern Sea.&nbsp; The
importance of this enormous construction has been variously
estimated by those who have written upon China, some of whom
preposterously exaggerate its importance, while others
laboriously seek to ridicule it; the probability being, that this
diversity of opinion arises from each writer having judged the
whole work by the particular specimen to which he had
access.&nbsp; Mr. Barrow, who, in 1793, accompanied Lord
Macartney to China, as historiographer to the British embassy,
made this calculation: he supposed that there were in England and
Scotland 1,800,000 houses, and estimating the masonry work of
each to be 2,000 cubic feet, he propounded that the aggregate did
not contain as much material as the Great Wall of China, which,
in his opinion, was enough for the construction of a wall to go
twice round the world.&nbsp; It is evident that Mr. Barrow
adopted, as the basis of his calculation, the Great Wall such as
he saw it north of Peking, where the construction is really grand
and imposing; but it is not to be supposed that this barrier,
raised against the irruptions of the barbarians, is, throughout
its extent, equally high, wide, and solid.&nbsp; We have crossed
it at fifteen different points, and on several occasions have
travelled for whole days parallel with it, and never once losing
sight of it; and often, instead of the great double turreted
rampart that exists towards Peking, we have found a mere low wall
of brickwork, or even earth work.&nbsp; In some places, indeed,
we have <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>found this famous barrier reduced to
its simplest expression, and composed merely of flint-stones
roughly piled up.&nbsp; As to the foundation wall, described by
Mr. Barrow, as consisting of large masses of free-stone cemented
with mortar, we can only say that we have never discovered the
slightest trace of any such work.&nbsp; It is indeed obvious that
Tsin-Chi-Hoang-Ti, in the execution of this great undertaking,
would fortify with especial care the vicinity of the capital, as
being the point to which the Tartar hordes would first direct
their aggressive steps.&nbsp; It is natural, farther, to
conceive, that the Mandarins charged with the execution of the
Emperor&rsquo;s plan, would, with especial conscientiousness,
perfect the works which were more immediately under the
Emperor&rsquo;s eye, and content themselves with erecting a more
or less nominal wall at remote points of the empire, particularly
those where the Tartars were little to be feared, as, for
example, the position of the Ortous and the Alechan
mountains.</p>
<p>The barrier of San-Yen-Tsin, which stands a few paces beyond
the wall, is noted for its great strictness towards the Tartars
who seek to enter within the intramural empire.&nbsp; The village
possesses only one inn, which is kept by the chief of the
frontier guards.&nbsp; Upon entering the court-yard we found
several groups of a camels assembled there belonging to a great
Tartar caravan that had arrived on the preceding evening.&nbsp;
There was, however, plenty of room for us, the establishment
being on a large scale.&nbsp; We had scarcely taken possession of
our chamber than the passport question was started.&nbsp; The
chief of the guards himself made an official demand for
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have none,&rdquo; replied we.&nbsp; At this
answer his features beamed with satisfaction, and he declared
that we could not proceed unless we paid a considerable
sum.&nbsp; &ldquo;How! a passport or money?&nbsp; Know that we
have travelled China from one end to the other; that we have been
to Peking, and that we have journeyed through Tartary, without
anything in the shape of a passport, and without having paid a
single sapek in lieu of a passport.&nbsp; You, who are a chief of
guards, must know that Lamas are privileged to travel wherever
they please without passports.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What words are
these?&nbsp; Here is a caravan at this very moment in the house,
and the two Lamas who are with it have both given me their
passports like the rest of the party.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If what
you say be true, the only conclusion is that there are some Lamas
who take passports with them and others who do not.&nbsp; We are
in the number of those who do not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finding at last
that the dispute was becoming tedious, we employed a decisive
course.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, come,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;we will
give you the money you ask, but you shall give us in return a
paper signed by yourself, in which you <!-- page 279--><a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>shall
acknowledge that, before you would permit us to pass, you exacted
from us a sum of money instead of passports.&nbsp; We shall then
address ourselves to the first Mandarin we meet, and ask him
whether what you have done is consistent with the laws of the
empire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man at once gave up the point.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since you have been to Peking,
no doubt the Emperor has given you special privileges,&rdquo; and
then he added, in a whisper, and smilingly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
tell the Tartars here that I have let you pass
<i>gratis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is really pitiable to observe these poor Mongols travelling
in China; everybody thinks himself entitled to fleece them, and
everybody succeeds in doing so to a marvellous extent.&nbsp; In
all directions they are encountered by impromptu custom-house
officers, by persons who exact money from them on all sorts of
pretences, for repairing roads, building bridges, constructing
pagodas, etc. etc.&nbsp; First, the despoilers proffer to render
them great services, call them brothers and friends, and give
them wholesale warnings against ill-designing persons who want to
rob them.&nbsp; Should this method not effect an unloosening of
the purse-strings, the rascals have recourse to intimidation,
frighten them horribly with visions of Mandarins, laws,
tribunals, prisons, punishments, threaten to take them up, and
treat them, in short, just like mere children.&nbsp; The Mongols
themselves materially aid the imposition by their total ignorance
of the manners and customs of China.&nbsp; At an inn, instead of
using the room offered to them, and putting their animals in the
stables, they pitch their tent in the middle of the court-yard,
plant stakes about it, and fasten their camels to these.&nbsp;
Very frequently they are not permitted to indulge this fancy, and
in this case they certainly enter the room allotted to them, and
which they regard in the light of a prison; but they proceed
there in a manner truly ridiculous.&nbsp; They set up their
trivet with their kettle upon it in the middle of the room, and
make a fire beneath with argols, of which they take care to have
a store with them.&nbsp; It is to no purpose they are told that
there is in the inn a large kitchen where they can cook their
meals far more comfortably to themselves; nothing will dissuade
them from their own kettle and their own aboriginal fire in the
middle of the room.&nbsp; When night comes they unroll their
hide-carpets round the fire, and there lie down.&nbsp; They would
not listen for a moment to the proposition of sleeping upon the
beds or upon the kang they find in the room ready for their
use.&nbsp; The Tartars of the caravan we found in the inn at
San-Yen-Tsin were allowed to carry on their domestic matters in
the open air.&nbsp; The simplicity of these poor children of the
desert was so great that they seriously asked us whether the <!--
page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>innkeeper would make them pay anything for the
accommodation he afforded them.</p>
<p>We continued on our way through the province of Kan-Sou,
proceeding to the south-west.&nbsp; The country, intersected with
streams and hills, is generally fine, and the people apparently
well off.&nbsp; The great variety of its productions is owing
partly to a temperate climate and a soil naturally fertile, but,
above all, to the activity and skill of the agriculturists.&nbsp;
The chief product of the district is wheat, of which the people
make excellent loaves, like those of Europe.&nbsp; They sow
scarcely any rice, procuring almost all the little they consume
from the adjacent provinces.&nbsp; Their goats and sheep are of
fine breed, and constitute, with bread, the principal food of the
population.&nbsp; Numerous and inexhaustible mines of coal place
fuel within everyone&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp; It appeared to us that
in Kan-Sou anyone might live very comfortably at extremely small
cost.</p>
<p>At two days distance from the barrier of San-Yen-Tsin we were
assailed by a hurricane which exposed us to very serious
danger.&nbsp; It was about ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&nbsp; We had just crossed a hill, and were entering upon
a plain of vast extent, when, all of a sudden, a profound calm
pervaded the atmosphere.&nbsp; There was not the slightest motion
in the air, and yet the cold was intense.&nbsp; Insensibly, the
sky assumed a dead-white colour; but there was not a cloud to be
seen.&nbsp; Soon, the wind began to blow from the west; in a very
short time it became so violent that our animals could scarcely
proceed.&nbsp; All nature seemed to be in a state of
dissolution.&nbsp; The sky, still cloudless, was covered with a
red tint.&nbsp; The fury of the wind increased; it raised in the
air enormous columns of dust, sand, and decayed vegetable matter,
which it then dashed right and left, here, there, and
everywhere.&nbsp; At length the wind blew so tremendously, and
the atmosphere became so utterly disorganised, that, at midday,
we could not distinguish the very animals upon which we were
riding.&nbsp; We dismounted, for it was impossible to advance a
single step, and after enveloping our faces in handkerchiefs in
order that we might not be blinded with the dust, we sat down
beside our animals.&nbsp; We had no notion where we were; our
only idea was that the frame of the world was unloosening, and
that the end of all things was close at hand.&nbsp; This lasted
for more than an hour.&nbsp; When the wind had somewhat
mitigated, and we could see around us, we found that we were all
separated from one another, and at considerable distances, for
amid that frightful tempest, bawl as loud as we might, we could
not hear each other&rsquo;s voices.&nbsp; So soon as we could at
all walk we proceeded towards a farm at no great distance, but
which we had not before perceived.&nbsp; The hurricane having
<!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>thrown down the great gate of the court we found no
difficulty in entering, and the house itself was opened to us
with almost equal facility; for Providence had guided us in our
distress to a family truly remarkable for its hospitality.</p>
<p>Immediately upon our arrival, our hosts heated some water for
us to wash with.&nbsp; We were in a frightful state; from head to
foot we were covered with dust which had saturated, so to speak,
our clothes and almost our skins.&nbsp; Had such a storm
encountered us on the Alechan mountains, we should have been
buried alive in the sand, and all trace of us lost for ever.</p>
<p>When we found that the worst of the storm was over, and that
the wind had subsided to occasional gusts, we proposed to
proceed, but our kind hosts would not hear of this; they said
they would lodge us for the night, and that our animals should
have plenty of food and water.&nbsp; Their invitation was so
sincere and so cordial, and we so greatly needed rest, that we
readily availed ourselves of their offer.</p>
<p>A very slight observation of the inhabitants of Kan-Sou, will
satisfy one that they are not of purely Chinese origin.&nbsp; The
Tartaro-Thibetian element is manifestly predominant amongst them;
and it displays itself with especial emphasis in the character,
manners, and language of the country people.&nbsp; You do not
find amongst them the exaggerated politeness which distinguishes
the Chinese; but, on the other hand, they are remarkable for
their open-heartedness and hospitality.&nbsp; In their particular
form of Chinese you hear an infinitude of expressions which
belong to the Tartar and Thibetian tongues.&nbsp; The
construction of their phrases, instead of following the Chinese
arrangement, always exhibits the inversions in use among the
Mongols.&nbsp; Thus, for example, they don&rsquo;t say, with the
Chinese, open the door, shut the window; but, the door open, the
window shut.&nbsp; Another peculiarity is that milk, butter,
curds, all insupportably odious to a Chinese, are especially
favourite food with the inhabitants of Kan-Sou.&nbsp; But it is,
above all, their religious turn of mind which distinguishes them
from the Chinese, a people almost universally sceptical and
indifferent as to religious matters.&nbsp; In Kan-Sou there are
numerous and flourishing Lamaseries in which reformed Buddhism is
followed.&nbsp; The Chinese, indeed, have plenty of pagodas and
idols of all sorts and sizes in their houses; but with them
religion is limited to this external representation, whereas in
Kan-Sou everyone prays often and long and fervently.&nbsp; Now
prayer, as everyone knows, is that which distinguishes the
religious from the irreligious man.</p>
<p>Besides differing materially from the other peoples of China,
the inhabitants of Kan-Sou differ materially amongst themselves,
<!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>the Dchiahours marking that sub-division, perhaps, more
distinctly than any of the other tribes.&nbsp; They occupy the
country commonly called <i>San-Tchouan</i> (Three Valleys), the
birthplace of our cameleer Samdadchiemba.&nbsp; The Dchiahours
possess all the knavery and cunning of the Chinese, without any
of their courtesy, and without their polished form of language,
and they are accordingly feared and disliked by all their
neighbours.&nbsp; When they consider themselves in any way
injured or insulted, they have immediate recourse to the dagger,
by way of remedy.&nbsp; With them the man most to be honoured is
he who has committed the greatest number of murders.&nbsp; They
have a language of their own, a medley of Mongol, Chinese, and
Eastern Thibetian.&nbsp; According to their own account, they are
of Tartar origin.&nbsp; If it be so, they may fairly claim to
have preserved, in all its integrity, the ferocious and
independent character of their ancestors, whereas the present
occupiers of Mongolia have greatly modified and softened their
manners.</p>
<p>Though subject to the Emperor of China, the Dchiahours are
immediately governed by a sort of hereditary sovereign belonging
to their tribe, and who bears the title of Tou-Sse.&nbsp; There
are in Kan-Sou, and on the frontiers of the province of
Sse-Tchouan, several other tribes, having their own special
rulers and their own especial laws.&nbsp; All these tribes are
called Tou-Sse, to which each adds, by way of distinction, the
family name of its chief or sovereign.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba, for
example, belonged to the Ki-Tou-Sse tribe of Dchiahours.&nbsp;
Yang-Tou-Sse is the most celebrated and the most redoubtable of
all these tribes, and for a long time exercised great influence
at Lha-Ssa, the capital of Thibet, but this influence was
destroyed in 1845, in consequence of an event which we shall
relate by-and-by.</p>
<p>After thoroughly resting from our fatigue, we departed early
next morning.&nbsp; Everywhere, on our way, we saw traces of the
tempest, in trees uprooted and torn, houses unroofed, fields
devastated and almost entirely deprived of their surface
soil.&nbsp; Before the end of the day, we arrived at
Tchoang-Long, more commonly called Ping-Fang, an ordinary town,
with a tolerable amount of trade, but in no way noticeable,
whether for its beauty or for its deformity.&nbsp; We went to
lodge at the Hotel of the Three Social Relations
(<i>San-Kan-Tien</i>), whose landlord was one of the best
humoured and most amusing persons we had hitherto met with.&nbsp;
He was a thorough Chinese: to give us a proof of his sagacity, he
asked us, point blank, whether we were not English; and that we
might thoroughly understand his question, he added that he
understood by Ing-Kie-Li, the sea-devils (<i>Yang-Kouei-Dze</i>)
who were making war at Canton.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, we are not
English; nor are we devils of any sort, whether of sea or
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>An idler who was standing by,
interposed to prevent the ill effect of this awkward
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said he to the innkeeper,
&ldquo;you know nothing of physiognomy.&nbsp; How could you
suppose that these people are Yang-Kouei-Dze?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you know that they have all blue eyes and red hair?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; returned the host, &ldquo;I had
not thought of that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said we,
&ldquo;clearly you had not thought at all.&nbsp; Do you suppose
that sea-monsters could live as we do, on land, and ride on
horses?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, quite so; the
Ing-Kie-Li, they say, never venture to quit the sea, for when
they&rsquo;re on land they tremble and die like fish out of
water.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were favoured with a good deal more
information of the same class, respecting the manners and
characters of the sea-devils, the up-shot of which, so far as we
were concerned, was the full admission that we did not belong to
the same race.</p>
<p>A little before night, an immense bustle pervaded the
inn.&nbsp; A Living Buddha had arrived, with a numerous train, on
his return from a journey into Thibet, his native country, to the
grand Lamasery, of which for many years he had been the superior,
and which was situated in the country of the Khalkhas, towards
the Russian frontier.&nbsp; As he entered the inn, a multitude of
zealous Buddhists, who had been awaiting him in the great
courtyard, prostrated themselves before him, their faces to the
ground.&nbsp; The Grand Lama proceeded to the apartment which had
been prepared for him, and night coming, the crowd
withdrew.&nbsp; When the inn had become tolerably clear, this
strange personage gave full play to his curiosity; he poked about
all over the inn, going into every room, and asking everybody all
sorts of questions, without sitting down or staying
anywhere.&nbsp; As we expected, he favoured us also with a
visit.&nbsp; When he entered our chamber, we were gravely seated
on the kang; we studiously abstained from rising at his entrance,
and contented ourselves with welcoming him by a motion of our
hands. He seemed rather surprised at this unceremonious
reception, but not at all disconcerted, Standing in the middle of
the room, he stared at each of us intently, one after the
other.&nbsp; We, like himself, preserving entire silence all the
while, exercised the privilege of which he had set us the
example, and examined him closely.&nbsp; Be seemed about fifty
years old; he was enveloped in a great robe of yellow taffeta,
and he wore red velvet Thibetian boots, with remarkably thick
soles.&nbsp; He was of the middle height, and comfortably stout;
his dark brown face denoted extreme good nature, but there was in
his eyes, when you attentively examined them, a strange, wild,
haggard expression, that was very alarming.&nbsp; At length he
addressed us in the Mongol tongue, which he spoke with great
facility.&nbsp; In the first instance, the conversation was
nothing more <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>than the ordinary phrases exchanged
between travellers, about one another&rsquo;s health,
destination, horses, the weather, and so on.&nbsp; When we found
him prolonging his visit, we invited him to sit down beside us on
the kang; he hesitated for a moment, conceiving, no doubt, that
in his quality as Living Buddha, it did not become him to place
himself on a level with mere mortals like ourselves.&nbsp;
However, as he had a great desire for a chat, he at last made up
his mind to sit down, and in fact he could not, without
compromising his dignity, remain any longer standing while we
sat.</p>
<p>A Breviary that lay on a small table beside us, immediately
attracted his attention, and he asked permission to examine
it.&nbsp; Upon our assenting, he took it up with both hands,
admired the binding and the gilt edges, opened it and turned over
the leaves, and then closing it again, raised it reverentially to
his forehead, saying, &ldquo;It is your Book of Prayer: we should
always honour and respect prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; By-and-by he
added, &ldquo;Your religion and ours are like this,&rdquo; and so
saying he put the knuckles of his two forefingers together.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;you are right; your creed and
ours are in a state of hostility, and we do not conceal from you
that the object of our journey and of our labours is to
substitute our prayers for those which are used in your
Lamaseries.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; he replied,
smilingly; &ldquo;I knew that long ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then took
up the Breviary again, and asked us explanations of the
engravings.&nbsp; He evinced no surprise at what we told him,
only, when we had related to him the subject of the plate
representing the crucifixion, he shook his head compassionately,
and raised his joined hands to his head.&nbsp; After he had
examined all the prints, he took the Breviary once more in both
hands, and raised it respectfully to his forehead.&nbsp; He then
rose, and having saluted us with great affability, withdrew, we
escorting him to the door.</p>
<p>Upon being left alone, we felt for a moment stupified as it
were at this singular visit.&nbsp; We tried to conceive what
thoughts could have filled the mind of the Living Buddha as he
sat there beside us, and what impression he had derived from the
sketch we gave him of our holy religion.&nbsp; Now, it seemed to
us that strange feelings must have arisen in his heart; and then
again, we imagined that after all he had felt nothing whatever,
but that, a mere ordinary person, he had mechanically availed
himself of his position, without reflection, and without himself
attaching any real importance to his pretended divinity.&nbsp; We
became so interested in the point, that we determined to see this
personage once more before we departed.&nbsp; As that departure
was fixed for an early hour next morning, we went, accordingly,
to return his visit before we slept.&nbsp; We found him in his
apartment, seated on thick large cushions, covered with <!-- page
285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>magnificent tiger-skins; before him stood, on a small
lacquer table, a silver tea-pot, and a steatite cup in a
richly-worked gold saucer.&nbsp; He was evidently in the last
stage of ennui, and was correspondingly delighted to see
us.&nbsp; For fear he should take it into his head to let us
remain standing, we proceeded, upon entering the room, to seat
ourselves beside him.&nbsp; His suite, who were assembled in a
contiguous room, which opened into their principal&rsquo;s, were
extremely shocked at this familiarity, and gave utterance to a
murmur of disapprobation.&nbsp; The Buddha himself, however, who
passed over the circumstance with a half-angry smile, rang a
silver bell, and desired a young Lama, who obeyed the summons, to
bring us some tea with milk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have often seen your
countrymen,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my Lamasery stands at no great
distance from your native land; the <i>Oros</i> (Russians) often
pass the frontier, but I have never known any of them before to
advance so far as you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not
Russians,&rdquo; said we; &ldquo;our country is a long way from
Russia.&rdquo;&nbsp; This answer seemed to surprise the Buddha;
he looked at us closely for some time, and then said, &ldquo;From
what country come you, then?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are from the
Western Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! you are P&eacute;ling, <a
name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285"
class="citation">[285]</a> of <i>Dchou-Ganga</i> (Eastern
Ganges), and your city is Galgata (Calcutta).&rdquo;&nbsp; The
notions of the Living Buddha, it is observable, though not
exactly correct, were not altogether destitute of meaning; he
could of course only class us among the peoples who were known to
him, and in supposing us first Russians and then English, he
manifested an acquaintance with geographical terms, by no means
contemptible under the circumstances.&nbsp; He would not be
persuaded, however, that we were not either Oros or P&eacute;ling
of Galgata.&nbsp; &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what matters it from what country we come, since we are
all brothers?&nbsp; Only let me advise you, while you are in
China, to be cautious not to tell everybody who you are.&nbsp;
The Chinese are a suspicious and ill-conditioned race, and they
might do you a mischief.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then talked to us about
Thibet, and the dreadful road thither that we should have to
traverse.&nbsp; Judging from our appearance, he said, he doubted
very much whether we were strong enough for the
undertaking.&nbsp; The words and the manner of the Grand Lama
were perfectly affable and kind, but there was a look in his eyes
to which we could not reconcile ourselves.&nbsp; We seemed to
read there something infernal, fiend-like.&nbsp; But for this
circumstance, which perhaps after all was mere fancy on our part,
we should have esteemed our Grand Lama friend a most amiable
personage.</p>
<p>From Tchoang-Long, or Ping-Fang, we proceeded to Ho-Kiao-Y,
<!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>or, as it is named on the maps, Tai-Toung-Fou.&nbsp;
The latter is the ancient denomination of the place, and is no
longer in popular use.&nbsp; The road was, throughout, covered
with oxen, asses, and small carts, all with loads of coal.&nbsp;
We resolved to sojourn for a few days at Ho-Kiao-Y, for the
purpose of giving rest to our animals, whose strength had become
almost exhausted; the horse and the mule, in particular, had
tumours on their sides, occasioned by the constant rubbing of the
saddle, and it was essential to have these cured before we
proceeded further.&nbsp; Having formed this project, our next
business was to inspect all the inns in the place, for the
purpose of selecting as our abode that which presented the most
favourable indications, and the Hotel of the Temperate Climates
was ultimately honoured with our choice.</p>
<p>Ever since our entry into the province of Kan-Sou, not a day
had passed in which Samdadchiemba had not enlarged upon the
subject of the Three Valleys and the Dchiahours.&nbsp; Though
there was no very immense amount of sentiment about him, he had a
great desire to revisit his native place, and to see once more
any members of his family who might happen to be surviving
there.&nbsp; We could not do otherwise than aid so laudable a
purpose; accordingly, when we were established in the Hotel of
the Temperate Climates, we granted to our cameleer eight
days&rsquo; leave of absence, wherein to revisit his so long
abandoned home.&nbsp; Eight days appeared to him fully sufficient
for the purpose: two to go in, two to come back in, and four to
be spent in the bosom of his family, relating to them all the
marvels he had witnessed abroad.&nbsp; We allowed him the use of
a camel, that he might appear among his friends with the greater
distinction; and five ounces of silver which we placed in his
purse completed his recommendations to a favourable
reception.</p>
<p>While awaiting the return of our Dchiahour, we were
exclusively occupied in taking care of our animals, and of
ourselves.&nbsp; Every day we had to go into the town to buy our
provisions, then to cook them, and, morning and evening, to water
our cattle at some distance from the inn.&nbsp; The master of the
house was one of those good-natured persons who, in their very
eagerness to oblige, become troublesome; and whose amiability of
intention scarcely induces one to pardon their importunity of
attention.&nbsp; The worthy man was incessantly thrusting himself
into our room, to give us advice how we ought to do this, that,
and the other.&nbsp; After altering the position of everything in
the chamber according to his fancy for the moment, he would go up
to the furnace, take off the lid of the saucepan, dip his finger
into the ragout, and licking it to see how the mess was going on,
add salt or ginger, or other condiment, <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>to the
infinite annoyance of M. Huc, who was officially charged with the
cooking department.&nbsp; At other times he would loudly protest
that we knew nothing about making up a fire, that the coals ought
to be laid so, and the wood so, and that a draught of air ought
to be kept up in this or that direction; and thereupon he would
take up the tongs and overturn our fire, to the immense
discomfiture of M. Gabet, who presided over that
department.&nbsp; At night he appeared to consider himself
especially indispensable, and would skip in every quarter of an
hour to see that the lamp was burning properly, and that the wick
was long enough, or short enough, and what not.&nbsp; At times he
had really the air of asking us how it was possible that we had
contrived to live without him, the one of us up to thirty-two
years of age, the other up to thirty-seven.&nbsp; However, among
the exuberance of attentions with which he bored us, there was
one which we readily accepted; it was in the matter of warming
our beds, the process of which was so singular, so peculiar, that
we had never had the opportunity elsewhere of observing it.</p>
<p>The kang, a species of furnace on which you lie, is not in
Kan-Sou constructed altogether of brickwork, as is the case in
Northern China, but the upper flooring consists of moveable
planks, placed closely beside one another.&nbsp; When they want
to heat the kang for sleeping purposes, they remove the planks,
and strew the interior of the kang with horse-dung, quite dry and
pulverised.&nbsp; Over this combustible they throw some lighted
cinders, and then replace the planks; the fire immediately
communicates itself to the dung, which, once lighted, continues
to smoulder; the heat and the smoke, having no exit, soon warm
the planks, and this produces a tepid temperature which, in
consequence of the slow combustion of the material, prevails
throughout the night.&nbsp; The talent of the kang-heater
consists in putting neither too much nor too little dung, in
strewing it properly, and in so arranging the cinders that
combustion shall commence at different points in the same moment
of time, in order that all the planks may equally benefit by the
warmth.&nbsp; Ashamed to have our bed warmed for us like
children, we one night essayed to perform this service for
ourselves, but the result was by no means happy, for while one of
us was nearly broiled to death, the other trembled with cold all
night long; the fact being, that owing to our want of skill, the
fire had actually caught the planks on one side of the kang,
while on the other the fuel had not lighted at all.&nbsp; The
host of the Hotel of the Temperate Climates was naturally
disgusted at the mischance, and in order to prevent its
recurrence, he locked the closing plank of the furnace, and
himself came every time to light it.</p>
<p><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>Our various domestic occupations, and the recitation of
our Breviary, passed away the time very smoothly at
Ho-Kiao-Y.&nbsp; On the eighth day, as had been agreed,
Samdadchiemba returned, but not alone; he was accompanied by a
lad, whose features bespoke him a brother of our cameleer, and as
such Samdadchiemba presented him to us.&nbsp; Our first interview
was very brief, for the two Dchiahours had scarcely presented
themselves before they disappeared.&nbsp; We imagined, at first,
that they were gone to pay their respects to the host, but it was
not so, for they almost immediately re-appeared with somewhat
more solemnity of manner than before.&nbsp; Samdadchiemba marched
in first: &ldquo;Babdcho,&rdquo; said he to his brother,
&ldquo;prostrate thyself before our masters, and present to them
the offerings of our poor family.&rdquo;&nbsp; The younger
Dchiahour made us three salutations in the Oriental fashion, and
then laid before us two great dishes, one of them full of fine
nuts, the other laden with three large loaves, in form resembling
those made in France.&nbsp; To afford Samdadchiemba the most
practical proof in our power that we were sensible to his
attention, we forthwith applied ourselves to one of the loaves,
which, with some of the nuts, constituted quite a delicious
repast, for never since our departure from France had we tasted
such excellent bread.</p>
<p>While engaged upon our banquet, we observed that the costume
of Samdadchiemba was reduced to its simplest expression; that
whereas he had gone decently attired, he had come back
half-covered with a few rags.&nbsp; We asked for an explanation
of this change, whereupon he gave us an account of the miserable
condition in which he had found his family.&nbsp; The father had
been dead for some time; his aged mother had become blind, so
that she had not enjoyed the happiness of seeing him.&nbsp; He
had two brothers, the one a mere child, the other the young man
whom he had brought with him, and who, the sole support of the
family, devoted his time to the cultivation of a small field
which still belonged to them, and to the tending the flocks of
other people for hire.&nbsp; This narrative at once explained
what Samdadchiemba had done with his clothes; he had given them
all to his poor old mother, without even excepting his travelling
cloak.&nbsp; We thought it our duty to propose that he should
remain, and devote himself to the assistance of his wretched
family; but he did not at all adopt the suggestion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;could I have the cruelty to
do such a thing as that!&nbsp; Could I ever think of going to
devour the little substance that remains to them?&nbsp; They can
scarcely subsist themselves: how could they possibly support me;
for I myself have no means of making a livelihood there&mdash;I
cannot labour at the soil, and there is no other way in which I
could help them.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>We
considered this resolution neither good nor great; but knowing,
as we did, the character of Samdadchiemba, it in no degree
surprised us.&nbsp; We did not insist upon his remaining, for we
were even better convinced than he himself was, that he could be
of no sort of service to his family.&nbsp; We did all we could
ourselves to aid these poor people, by giving
Samdadchiemba&rsquo;s brother as large an alms as we could spare;
and we then proceeded to the preparations for our departure.</p>
<p>During these eight days of repose, the condition of our
animals had so improved as to enable us to venture upon the
difficult road we had to traverse.&nbsp; The next day after
quitting Ho-Kiao-Y, we began the ascent of the high mountain
called Ping-Keou, the terribly rugged paths of which interposed
almost insurmountable difficulties in the way of our
camels.&nbsp; On the ascent, we were obliged to be constantly
calling out, at the pitch of our voices, in order to warn any
muleteers who might be coming down the road, which was so narrow
and dangerous that two animals could not pass each other
abreast.&nbsp; Our cries were to enable any persons coming the
other way to lead their mules aside, so that they might not take
alarm at the sight of our camels, and dash over the
precipice.&nbsp; We began the ascent of this mountain before
daybreak, and yet it was noon before we reached its summit.&nbsp;
There we found a little inn, where, under the denomination of
tea, they sold a decoction of burned beans.&nbsp; We stopped at
this place for a brief period to take a repast, which hunger
rendered very succulent and savoury, of some nuts and a slice of
the famous bread which the Dchiahour had brought us, and which we
expended with the utmost parsimony.&nbsp; A draught of cold water
should have been, according to our previous plan, the complement
of our feast; but the only water attainable on this mountain was
affected with an insupportable stench.&nbsp; We were fain,
therefore, to have recourse to the decoction of baked beans, a
dreadfully insipid fluid, but for which, notwithstanding, we were
charged extortionately.</p>
<p>The cold was by no means so severe as we had expected from the
season of the year and the great elevation of the mountain.&nbsp;
In the afternoon, indeed, the weather was quite mild; by-and-by,
the sky was overcast, and snow fell.&nbsp; As we were obliged to
descend the mountain on foot, we soon got absolutely hot, in the
perpetual struggle, of a very laborious kind, to keep from
rolling down the slippery path.&nbsp; One of our camels fell
twice, but happily in each instance he was stayed by a rock from
tumbling over the mountain&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Having placed behind us the formidable Ping-Keou, we took up
our lodging in the village of the Old Duck
(<i>Lao-Ya-Pou</i>).&nbsp; Here <!-- page 290--><a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>we found a
system of heating in operation different from that of
Ho-Kiao-Y.&nbsp; The kangs here are warmed, not with dried
horse-dung, but with coal-dust, reduced to paste, and then formed
into bricks; turf is also used for the purpose.&nbsp; We had
hitherto imagined that knitting was unknown in China; the village
of the Old Duck removed this misconception from our minds, and
enabled us, indeed, to remove it from the minds of the Chinese
themselves in other parts of the empire.&nbsp; We found here in
every street men, not women, occupied in this species of
industry.&nbsp; Their productions are wholly without taste or
delicacy of execution; they merely knit coarse cotton into
shapeless stockings, like sacks, or sometimes gloves, without any
separation for the fingers, and merely a place for the thumb, the
knitting needles being small canes of bamboo.&nbsp; It was for us
a singular spectacle to see parties of moustachioed men sitting
before the door of their houses in the sun, knitting, sewing, and
chattering like so many female gossips; it looked quite like a
burlesque upon the manners of Europe.</p>
<p>From Lao-Ya-Pou to Si-Ning-Fou was five days march; on the
second day we passed through Ning-Pey-Hien, a town of the third
order.&nbsp; Outside the western gate, we stopped at an inn to
take our morning meal; a great many travellers were already
assembled in the large kitchen, occupying the tables which were
ranged along the walls; in the centre of the room were several
furnaces, where the innkeeper, his wife, several children, and
some servants were actively preparing the dishes required by the
guests.&nbsp; While every body seemed occupied, either in the
preparation or in the consumption of victuals, a loud cry was
heard.&nbsp; It was the hostess, thus expressing the pain
occasioned by a knock on her head, which the husband had
administered with a shovel.&nbsp; At the cry, all the travellers
looked in the direction whence it proceeded; the woman retreated,
with vehement vociferations, to a corner of the kitchen; the
innkeeper explained to the company that he had been compelled to
correct his wife for insolence, insubordination, and an
indifference to the interests of the establishment, which
eminently compromised its prosperity.&nbsp; Before he had
finished his version of the story, the wife, from her retreat in
the corner, commenced her&rsquo;s; she informed the company that
her husband was an idle vagabond, who passed his time in drinking
and smoking, expending the result of her labours for a whole
month in a few days of brandy and tobacco.&nbsp; During this
extempore performance, the audience remained imperturbably calm,
giving not the smallest indication of approbation or
disapprobation.&nbsp; At length the wife issued from her retreat,
and advanced with a sort of challenging air to the husband:
&ldquo;Since I am a wicked woman,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;you
must kill me.&nbsp; Come, kill <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>me!&rdquo;
and so saying, she drew herself up with a gesture of vast
dramatic dignity immediately in front of the husband.&nbsp; The
latter did not adopt the suggestion to kill her, but he gave her
a formidable box on the ear, which sent her back, screaming at
the pitch of her voice, into her previous corner.&nbsp; Hereupon,
the audience burst into loud laughter; but the affair, which
seemed to them so diverting, soon took a very serious turn.&nbsp;
After the most terrible abuse on the one hand, and the most awful
threats on the other, the innkeeper at length drew his girdle
tight about his waist, and twisted his tress of hair about his
head, in token of some decided proceeding.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since you
will have me kill you,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I will kill
you!&rdquo; and so saying, he took from the furnace a pair of
long iron tongs, and rushed furiously upon his wife.&nbsp;
Everybody at once rose and shouted; the neighbours ran in, and
all present endeavoured to separate the combatants, but they did
not effect the object until the woman&rsquo;s face was covered
with blood, and her hair was all down about her shoulders.&nbsp;
Then a man of ripe years, who seemed to exercise some authority
in the house, gravely pronounced these words by way of epilogue:
&ldquo;How! what!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;husband and wife
fighting thus! and in presence of their children, in presence of
a crowd of travellers!&rdquo;&nbsp; These words, repeated three
or four times, in a tone which expressed at once indignation and
authority, had a marvellous effect.&nbsp; Almost immediately
afterwards the guests resumed their dinner, the hostess fried
cakes in nut-oil, and the host silently smoked his pipe.</p>
<p>When we were about to depart, the innkeeper, in summing up our
account, coolly inserted fifty sapeks for the animals which we
had tied up in the court-yard during our meal.&nbsp; He had
evidently an idea of making us pay <i>en Tartare</i>.&nbsp;
Samdadchiemba was indignant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo;
asked he, &ldquo;that we Dchiahours don&rsquo;t know the rules of
inns?&nbsp; Where did you ever hear of making people pay for
fastening their animals to a peg in the wall?&nbsp; Tell me,
master publican, how many sapeks are you going to charge us for
the comedy we&rsquo;ve just witnessed of the innkeeper and his
wife?&rdquo;&nbsp; The burst of laughter on the part of the
bystanders which hailed this sarcasm carried the day triumphantly
for Samdadchiemba, and we departed without paying anything beyond
our personal expenses.</p>
<p>The road thence to Si-Ning-Fou, generally well made and well
kept, meanders through a fertile and well cultivated country,
picturesquely diversified by trees, hills, and numerous
streams.&nbsp; Tobacco is the staple of the district.&nbsp; We
saw on our way several water-mills, remarkable for their
simplicity, as is the case with all Chinese works.&nbsp; In these
mills, the upper story is stationary, <!-- page 292--><a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>while the
lower is turned by means of a single wheel, kept in motion by the
current.&nbsp; To work these mills, though they are frequently of
large proportions, a very small stream suffices, as the stream
plays upon the wheel in the form of a cascade, at least twenty
feet high.</p>
<p>On the day before arriving at Si-Ning-Fou, we passed over a
road extremely laborious, and so dangerously rugged that it
suggested frequent recommendations of ourselves to the protection
of the Divine Providence.&nbsp; Our course was amid enormous
rocks, beside a deep, fierce current, the tumultuous waves of
which roared beneath us.&nbsp; There was the gulf perpetually
yawning to swallow us up, should we make but one false step; we
trembled, above all, for our camels, awkward and lumbering as
they were, whenever they had to pass over an uneven road.&nbsp;
At length, thanks to the goodness of God, we arrived without
accident at Si-Ning.&nbsp; The town is of very large extent, but
its population is limited, and itself, in several parts, is
falling into absolute decay.&nbsp; The history of the matter is,
that its commerce has been in great measure intercepted by
Tang-Keou-Eul, a small town on the banks of the Keou-Ho, the
frontier which separates Kan-Sou from Koukou-Noor.</p>
<p>It is the custom, we may say the rule, at Si-Ning-Fou, not to
receive strangers, such as the Tartars, Thibetians, and others,
into the inns, but to relegate them to establishments called
Houses of Repose (<i>Sie-Kia</i>), into which no other travellers
are admitted.&nbsp; We proceeded accordingly to one of these
Houses of Repose, where we were exceedingly well
entertained.&nbsp; The Sie-Kia differ from other inns in this
important particular, that the guests are boarded, lodged, and
served there gratuitously.&nbsp; Commerce being the leading
object of travellers hither, the chiefs of the Sie-Kia indemnify
themselves for their outlay by a recognised per centage upon all
the goods which their guests buy or sell.&nbsp; The persons who
keep these Houses of Repose have first to procure a license from
the authorities of the town, for which they pay a certain sum,
greater or less, according to the character of the commercial men
who are expected to frequent the house.&nbsp; In outward show,
the guests are well-treated, but still they are quite at the
mercy of the landlords, who, having an understanding with the
traders of the town, manage to make money of both parties.</p>
<p>When we, indeed, departed from Si-Ning-Fou, the Sie-Kia with
whom we had lodged had made nothing by us in the ordinary way,
for we had neither bought nor sold anything.&nbsp; However, as it
would have been preposterous and unjust on our part to have lived
thus at the expense of our neighbours, we paid the host of the
House of Repose for what we had had, at the ordinary tavern
rate.</p>
<p><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>After crossing several torrents, ascending many rocky
hills, and twice passing the Great Wall, we arrived at
Tang-Keou-Eul.&nbsp; It was now January, and nearly four months
had elapsed since our departure from the Valley of Dark
Waters.&nbsp; Tang-Keou-Eul is a small town, but very populous,
very animated, and very full of business.&nbsp; It is a regular
tower of Babel, wherein you find collected Eastern Thibetians,
<i>Houng-Mao-Eul</i> (Long-haired Folk), Eleuts, Kolos, Chinese,
Tartars from the Blue Sea, and Mussulmans, descended from the
ancient migrations from Turkestan.&nbsp; Everything in the town
bears the impress of violence.&nbsp; Nobody walks the streets
without a great sabre at his side, and without affecting, at
least, a fierce determination to use it on the shortest
notice.&nbsp; Not an hour passes without some street combat.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
